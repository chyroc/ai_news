We propose an OmniFusion model based on a pretrained LLM and adapters for visual modality. We evaluated and compared several architecture design principles for better text and visual data coupling: MLP and transformer adapters, various CLIP ViT-based encoders (SigLIP, InternVIT, etc.), and their fusing approach, image encoding method (whole image or tiles encoding) and two 7B LLMs (the proprietary one and open-source Mistral). Experiments on 8 visual-language benchmarks show the top score for the best OmniFusion setup in terms of different VQA tasks in comparison with open-source LLaVA-like solutions: VizWiz, Pope, MM-Vet, ScienceQA, MMBench, TextVQA, VQAv2, MMMU. We also propose a variety of situations, where OmniFusion provides highly-detailed answers in different domains: housekeeping, sightseeing, culture, medicine, handwritten and scanned equations recognition, etc. Mistral-based OmniFusion model is an open-source solution with weights, training and inference scripts available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/OmniFusion.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06212</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06212</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 02:20:20 GMT</pubDate><author>Elizaveta Goncharova, Anton Razzhigaev, Matvey Mikhalchuk, Maxim Kurkin, Irina Abdullaeva, Matvey Skripkin, Ivan Oseledets, Denis Dimitrov, Andrey Kuznetsov</author></item><item><title>Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models</title><description>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. Without fine-tuning, we find them to be limited. This suggests that much of the few-shot performance on novel datasets is due to the LLM&#39;s world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We make the exposure tests we developed available as the tabmemcheck Python package at https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 02:13:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Sebastian Bordt, Harsha Nori, Vanessa Rodrigues, Besmira Nushi, Rich Caruana</author></item><item><title>CodecLM: Aligning Language Models with Tailored Synthetic Data</title><description>Instruction tuning has emerged as the key in aligning large language models (LLMs) with specific task instructions, thereby mitigating the discrepancy between the next-token prediction objective and users&#39; actual goals. To reduce the labor and time cost to collect or annotate data by humans, researchers start to explore the use of LLMs to generate instruction-aligned synthetic data. Recent works focus on generating diverse instructions and applying LLM to increase instruction complexity, often neglecting downstream use cases. It remains unclear how to tailor high-quality data to elicit better instruction-following abilities in different target instruction distributions and LLMs. To this end, we introduce CodecLM, a general framework for adaptively generating high-quality synthetic data for LLM alignment with different downstream instruction distributions and LLMs. Drawing on the Encode-Decode principles, we use LLMs as codecs to guide the data generation process. We first encode seed instructions into metadata, which are concise keywords generated on-the-fly to capture the target instruction distribution, and then decode metadata to create tailored instructions. We also introduce Self-Rubrics and Contrastive Filtering during decoding to tailor data-efficient samples. Extensive experiments on four open-domain instruction following benchmarks validate the effectiveness of CodecLM over the current state-of-the-arts.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05875</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05875</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 02:08:56 GMT</pubDate><author>Zifeng Wang, Chun-Liang Li, Vincent Perot, Long T.

One approach to address these issues has been to take an existing pre-trained LLM and continue to train it on new languages. While prior works have experimented with language adaptation, many questions around best practices and methodology have not been covered. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the adaptation of LLMs to new languages. Our study covers the key components in this process, including vocabulary extension, direct preference optimization and the data scarcity problem for human alignment in low-resource languages. We scale these experiments across 9 languages and 2 parameter scales (7B and 70B). We compare our models against Llama 2, Aya-101, XGLM, BLOOM and existing language experts, outperforming all prior published baselines. Additionally, all evaluation code and checkpoints are made public to facilitate future research.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05829</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05829</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 02:03:46 GMT</pubDate><author>Zoltan Csaki, Bo Li, Jonathan Li, Qiantong Xu, Pian Pawakapan, Leon Zhang, Yun Du, Hengyu Zhao, Changran Hu, Urmish Thakker</author></item><item><title>LLM2Vec: Large Language Models Are Secretly Powerful Text Encoders</title><description>Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today&#39;s NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 3 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 7B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data. Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05961</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05961</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 01:56:06 GMT</pubDate><author>Parishad BehnamGhader, Vaibhav Adlakha, Marius Mosbach, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Nicolas Chapados, Siva Reddy</author></item><item><title>InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD: A Pioneering Large Vision-Language Model Handling Resolutions from 336 Pixels to 4K HD</title><description>The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) field has seen significant advancements, yet its progression has been hindered by challenges in comprehending fine-grained visual content due to limited resolution. Recent efforts have aimed to enhance the high-resolution understanding capabilities of LVLMs, yet they remain capped at approximately 1500 x 1500 pixels and constrained to a relatively narrow resolution range. This paper represents InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD, a groundbreaking exploration into elevating LVLM resolution capabilities up to 4K HD (3840 x 1600) and beyond. Concurrently, considering the ultra-high resolution may not be necessary in all scenarios, it supports a wide range of diverse resolutions from 336 pixels to 4K standard, significantly broadening its scope of applicability. Specifically, this research advances the patch division paradigm by introducing a novel extension: dynamic resolution with automatic patch configuration. It maintains the training image aspect ratios while automatically varying patch counts and configuring layouts based on a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) (336 x 336), leading to dynamic training resolution from 336 pixels to 4K standard. Our research demonstrates that scaling training resolution up to 4K HD leads to consistent performance enhancements without hitting the ceiling of potential improvements. InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD shows superb capability that matches or even surpasses GPT-4V and Gemini Pro in 10 of the 16 benchmarks. The InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD model series with 7B parameters are publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06512</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06512</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 01:48:52 GMT</pubDate><author>Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Songyang Zhang, Haodong Duan, Wenwei Zhang, Yining Li, Hang Yan, Yang Gao, Zhe Chen, Xinyue Zhang, Wei Li, Jingwen Li, Wenhai Wang, Kai Chen, Conghui He, Xingcheng Zhang, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</author></item><item><title>MuPT: A Generative Symbolic Music Pretrained Transformer</title><description>In this paper, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the pre-training of music. While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is well-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible with ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths, thereby enhancing the model&#39;s performance in musical composition. To address the challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during generation, we propose the development of a Synchronized Multi-Track ABC Notation (SMT-ABC Notation), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple musical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of handling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90\% of the symbolic music data in our training set. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the Symbolic Music Scaling Law (SMS Law) on model performance. The results indicate a promising direction for future research in music generation, offering extensive resources for community-led research through our open-source contributions.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06393</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06393</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 01:46:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Xingwei Qu, Yuelin Bai, Yinghao Ma, Ziya Zhou, Ka Man Lo, Jiaheng Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Lejun Min, Xueling Liu, Tianyu Zhang, Xinrun Du, Shuyue Guo, Yiming Liang, Yizhi Li, Shangda Wu, Junting Zhou, Tianyu Zheng, Ziyang Ma, Fengze Han, Wei Xue, Gus Xia, Emmanouil Benetos, Xiang Yue, Chenghua Lin, Xu Tan, Stephen W.

One promising solution involves the fine-tuning of pre-trained 2D diffusion models to harness their capacity for producing multi-view images, which are then lifted into accurate 3D models via methods like fast-NeRFs or large reconstruction models. However, as inconsistency still exists and limited generated resolution, the generation results of such methods still lack intricate textures and complex geometries. To solve this problem, we propose Magic-Boost, a multi-view conditioned diffusion model that significantly refines coarse generative results through a brief period of SDS optimization (sim15min). Compared to the previous text or single image based diffusion models, Magic-Boost exhibits a robust capability to generate images with high consistency from pseudo synthesized multi-view images. It provides precise SDS guidance that well aligns with the identity of the input images, enriching the local detail in both geometry and texture of the initial generative results. Extensive experiments show Magic-Boost greatly enhances the coarse inputs and generates high-quality 3D assets with rich geometric and textural details.
