Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model&#39;s parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general methodology for eliciting directions in the parameter space (termed &quot;concept vectors&quot;) that encode concrete concepts, and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge from the LLMs and significantly reduces their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parametric-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11614</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11614</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:53:10 GMT</pubDate><author>Yihuai Hong, Lei Yu, Shauli Ravfogel, Haiqin Yang, Mor Geva</author></item><item><title>Interface Design for Self-Supervised Speech Models</title><description>Self-supervised speech (SSL) models have recently become widely adopted for many downstream speech processing tasks. The general usage pattern is to employ SSL models as feature extractors, and then train a downstream prediction head to solve a specific task. However, different layers of SSL models have been shown to capture different types of information, and the methods of combining them are not well studied. To this end, we extend the general framework for SSL model utilization by proposing the interface that connects the upstream and downstream. Under this view, the dominant technique of combining features via a layerwise weighted sum can be regarded as a specific interface. We propose several alternative interface designs and demonstrate that the weighted sum interface is suboptimal for many tasks. In particular, we show that a convolutional interface whose depth scales logarithmically with the depth of the upstream model consistently outperforms many other interface designs.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12209</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12209</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 12:03:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Yi-Jen Shih, David Harwath</author></item><item><title>Breaking Boundaries: Investigating the Effects of Model Editing on Cross-linguistic Performance</title><description>The integration of pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized NLP, particularly for English, but it has also created linguistic imbalances. This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like &#39;each language for itself&#39; (ELFI) and &#39;each language for others&#39; (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11139</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11139</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 10:24:49 GMT</pubDate><author>Somnath Banerjee, Avik Halder, Rajarshi Mandal, Sayan Layek, Ian Soboroff, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee</author></item><item><title>Self-MoE: Towards Compositional Large Language Models with Self-Specialized Experts</title><description>We present Self-MoE, an approach that transforms a monolithic LLM into a compositional, modular system of self-specialized experts, named MiXSE (MiXture of Self-specialized Experts). Our approach leverages self-specialization, which constructs expert modules using self-generated synthetic data, each equipped with a shared base LLM and incorporating self-optimized routing. This allows for dynamic and capability-specific handling of various target tasks, enhancing overall capabilities, without extensive human-labeled data and added parameters. Our empirical results reveal that specializing LLMs may exhibit potential trade-offs in performances on non-specialized tasks. On the other hand, our Self-MoE demonstrates substantial improvements over the base LLM across diverse benchmarks such as knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. It also consistently outperforms other methods, including instance merging and weight merging, while offering better flexibility and interpretability by design with semantic experts and routing. Our findings highlight the critical role of modularity and the potential of self-improvement in achieving efficient, scalable, and adaptable systems.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12034</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12034</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 07:01:32 GMT</pubDate><author>Junmo Kang, Leonid Karlinsky, Hongyin Luo, Zhen Wang, Jacob Hansen, James Glass, David Cox, Rameswar Panda, Rogerio Feris, Alan Ritter</author></item><item><title>Long Code Arena: a Set of Benchmarks for Long-Context Code Models</title><description>Nowadays, the fields of code and natural language processing are evolving rapidly. In particular, models become better at processing long context windows - supported context sizes have increased by orders of magnitude over the last few years. However, there is a shortage of benchmarks for code processing that go beyond a single file of context, while the most popular ones are limited to a single method. With this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing Long Code Arena, a suite of six benchmarks for code processing tasks that require project-wide context. These tasks cover different aspects of code processing: library-based code generation, CI builds repair, project-level code completion, commit message generation, bug localization, and module summarization. For each task, we provide a manually verified dataset for testing, an evaluation suite, and open-source baseline solutions based on popular LLMs to showcase the usage of the dataset and to simplify adoption by other researchers. We publish the benchmark page on HuggingFace Spaces with the leaderboard, links to HuggingFace Hub for all the datasets, and link to the GitHub repository with baselines: https://huggingface.co/spaces/JetBrains-Research/long-code-arena.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11612</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11612</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 03:56:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Egor Bogomolov, Aleksandra Eliseeva, Timur Galimzyanov, Evgeniy Glukhov, Anton Shapkin, Maria Tigina, Yaroslav Golubev, Alexander Kovrigin, Arie van Deursen, Maliheh Izadi, Timofey Bryksin</author></item><item><title>Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models</title><description>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT&#39;s predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 03:43:38 GMT</pubDate><author>Hengyi Wang, Shiwei Tan, Hao Wang</author></item><item><title>Multimodal Needle in a Haystack: Benchmarking Long-Context Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models</title><description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant promise in various applications, leading to broad interest from researchers and practitioners alike. However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models. All the code, data, and instructions required to reproduce the main results are available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/multimodal-needle-in-a-haystack.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11230</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11230</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 03:28:57 GMT</pubDate><author>Hengyi Wang, Haizhou Shi, Shiwei Tan, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Tunyu Zhang, Akshay Nambi, Tanuja Ganu, Hao Wang</author></item></channel></rss>
