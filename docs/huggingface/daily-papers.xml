To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10817</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10817</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 18:33:10 GMT</pubDate><author>Tu Vu, Kalpesh Krishna, Salaheddin Alzubi, Chris Tar, Manaal Faruqui, Yun-Hsuan Sung</author></item><item><title>Spider2-V: How Far Are Multimodal Agents From Automating Data Science and Engineering Workflows?</title><description>Data science and engineering workflows often span multiple stages, from warehousing to orchestration, using tools like BigQuery, dbt, and Airbyte. As vision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code generation, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by generating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations. This automation can improve the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal agent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments and incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications. These tasks, derived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent to perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems. To balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic configurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for each task. Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive documents of these enterprise data software systems. Our empirical evaluation reveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success). Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%). We hope that Spider2-V paves the way for autonomous multimodal agents to transform the automation of data science and engineering workflow. Our code and data are available at https://spider2-v.github.io.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10956</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10956</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 17:32:44 GMT</pubDate><author>Ruisheng Cao, Fangyu Lei, Haoyuan Wu, Jixuan Chen, Yeqiao Fu, Hongcheng Gao, Xinzhuang Xiong, Hanchong Zhang, Yuchen Mao, Wenjing Hu, Tianbao Xie, Hongshen Xu, Danyang Zhang, Sida Wang, Ruoxi Sun, Pengcheng Yin, Caiming Xiong, Ansong Ni, Qian Liu, Victor Zhong, Lu Chen, Kai Yu, Tao Yu</author></item><item><title>LLM Circuit Analyses Are Consistent Across Training and Scale</title><description>Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous training or additional finetuning. By contrast, most research into LLMs&#39; internal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training), raising the question of whether their results generalize to real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on encoder-only or toy models, which differ significantly from most deployed models. In this study, we track how model mechanisms, operationalized as circuits, emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in decoder-only LLMs, in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters. We find that task abilities and the functional components that support them emerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover, although such components may be implemented by different attention heads over time, the overarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly, both these algorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across model scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small models at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after additional pre-training and over model scale.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10827</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10827</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:29:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Curt Tigges, Michael Hanna, Qinan Yu, Stella Biderman</author></item><item><title>Q-Sparse: All Large Language Models can be Fully Sparsely-Activated</title><description>We introduce, Q-Sparse, a simple yet effective approach to training sparsely-activated large language models (LLMs). Q-Sparse enables full sparsity of activations in LLMs which can bring significant efficiency gains in inference. This is achieved by applying top-K sparsification to the activations and the straight-through-estimator to the training. The key results from this work are, (1) Q-Sparse can achieve results comparable to those of baseline LLMs while being much more efficient at inference time; (2) We present an inference-optimal scaling law for sparsely-activated LLMs; (3) Q-Sparse is effective in different settings, including training-from-scratch, continue-training of off-the-shelf LLMs, and finetuning; (4) Q-Sparse works for both full-precision and 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). Particularly, the synergy of BitNet b1.58 and Q-Sparse (can be equipped with MoE) provides the cornerstone and a clear path to revolutionize the efficiency, including cost and energy consumption, of future LLMs.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10969</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10969</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 05:11:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Ruiping Wang, Furu Wei</author></item><item><title>DataDream: Few-shot Guided Dataset Generation</title><description>While text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in image synthesis, they have yet to prove their effectiveness in downstream applications. Previous work has proposed to generate data for image classifier training given limited real data access. However, these methods struggle to generate in-distribution images or depict fine-grained features, thereby hindering the generalization of classification models trained on synthetic datasets. We propose DataDream, a framework for synthesizing classification datasets that more faithfully represents the real data distribution when guided by few-shot examples of the target classes. DataDream fine-tunes LoRA weights for the image generation model on the few real images before generating the training data using the adapted model. We then fine-tune LoRA weights for CLIP using the synthetic data to improve downstream image classification over previous approaches on a large variety of datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of DataDream through extensive experiments, surpassing state-of-the-art classification accuracy with few-shot data across 7 out of 10 datasets, while being competitive on the other 3. Additionally, we provide insights into the impact of various factors, such as the number of real-shot and generated images as well as the fine-tuning compute on model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/DataDream.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10910</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10910</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 04:42:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Jae Myung Kim, Jessica Bader, Stephan Alaniz, Cordelia Schmid, Zeynep Akata</author></item><item><title>MMM: Multilingual Mutual Reinforcement Effect Mix Datasets &amp; Test with Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Models</title><description>The Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) represents a promising avenue in information extraction and multitasking research. Nevertheless, its applicability has been constrained due to the exclusive availability of MRE mix datasets in Japanese, thereby limiting comprehensive exploration by the global research community. To address this limitation, we introduce a Multilingual MRE mix dataset (MMM) that encompasses 21 sub-datasets in English, Japanese, and Chinese. In this paper, we also propose a method for dataset translation assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), which significantly reduces the manual annotation time required for dataset construction by leveraging LLMs to translate the original Japanese datasets. Additionally, we have enriched the dataset by incorporating open-domain Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentence classification tasks. Utilizing this expanded dataset, we developed a unified input-output framework to train an Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Model (OIELLM). The OIELLM model demonstrates the capability to effectively process novel MMM datasets, exhibiting significant improvements in performance.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10953</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10953</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 04:37:33 GMT</pubDate><author>Chengguang Gan, Qingyu Yin, Xinyang He, Hanjun Wei, Yunhao Liang, Younghun Lim, Shijian Wang, Hexiang Huang, Qinghao Zhang, Shiwen Ni, Tatsunori Mori</author></item><item><title>Learning to Refuse: Towards Mitigating Privacy Risks in LLMs</title><description>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language. However, these models can inadvertently memorize private information, posing significant privacy risks. This study addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to protect specific individuals&#39; private data without the need for complete retraining. We propose \return, a Real-world pErsonal daTa UnleaRNing dataset, comprising 2,492 individuals from Wikipedia with associated QA pairs, to evaluate machine unlearning (MU) methods for protecting personal data in a realistic scenario. Additionally, we introduce the Name-Aware Unlearning Framework (NAUF) for Privacy Protection, which enables the model to learn which individuals&#39; information should be protected without affecting its ability to answer questions related to other unrelated individuals. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NAUF achieves a state-of-the-art average unlearning score, surpassing the best baseline method by 5.65 points, effectively protecting target individuals&#39; personal data while maintaining the model&#39;s general capabilities.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10058</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10058</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 04:32:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhenhua Liu, Tong Zhu, Chuanyuan Tan, Wenliang Chen</author></item><item><title>GRUtopia: Dream General Robots in a City at Scale</title><description>Recent works have been exploring the scaling laws in the field of Embodied AI. Given the prohibitive costs of collecting real-world data, we believe the Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) paradigm is a crucial step for scaling the learning of embodied models. This paper introduces project GRUtopia, the first simulated interactive 3D society designed for various robots. It features several advancements: (a) The scene dataset, GRScenes, includes 100k interactive, finely annotated scenes, which can be freely combined into city-scale environments. In contrast to previous works mainly focusing on home, GRScenes covers 89 diverse scene categories, bridging the gap of service-oriented environments where general robots would be initially deployed. (b) GRResidents, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven Non-Player Character (NPC) system that is responsible for social interaction, task generation, and task assignment, thus simulating social scenarios for embodied AI applications. (c) The benchmark, GRBench, supports various robots but focuses on legged robots as primary agents and poses moderately challenging tasks involving Object Loco-Navigation, Social Loco-Navigation, and Loco-Manipulation. We hope that this work can alleviate the scarcity of high-quality data in this field and provide a more comprehensive assessment of Embodied AI research.

Importantly, the generated sound onsets should match the visual actions that are aligned with them, otherwise unnatural synchronization artifacts arise. Recent works have explored the progression of conditioning sound generators on still images and then video features, focusing on quality and semantic matching while ignoring synchronization, or by sacrificing some amount of quality to focus on improving synchronization only. In this work, we propose a V2A generative model, named MaskVAT, that interconnects a full-band high-quality general audio codec with a sequence-to-sequence masked generative model. This combination allows modeling both high audio quality, semantic matching, and temporal synchronicity at the same time. Our results show that, by combining a high-quality codec with the proper pre-trained audio-visual features and a sequence-to-sequence parallel structure, we are able to yield highly synchronized results on one hand, whilst being competitive with the state of the art of non-codec generative audio models.

Today, many benchmarks exist to measure LLM knowledge and reasoning on textbook-style science questions, but few if any benchmarks are designed to evaluate language model performance on practical tasks required for scientific research, such as literature search, protocol planning, and data analysis. As a step toward building such benchmarks, we introduce the Language Agent Biology Benchmark (LAB-Bench), a broad dataset of over 2,400 multiple choice questions for evaluating AI systems on a range of practical biology research capabilities, including recall and reasoning over literature, interpretation of figures, access and navigation of databases, and comprehension and manipulation of DNA and protein sequences. Importantly, in contrast to previous scientific benchmarks, we expect that an AI system that can achieve consistently high scores on the more difficult LAB-Bench tasks would serve as a useful assistant for researchers in areas such as literature search and molecular cloning. As an initial assessment of the emergent scientific task capabilities of frontier language models, we measure performance of several against our benchmark and report results compared to human expert biology researchers. We will continue to update and expand LAB-Bench over time, and expect it to serve as a useful tool in the development of automated research systems going forward. A public subset of LAB-Bench is available for use at the following URL: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futurehouse/lab-bench</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10362</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10362</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 02:11:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Jon M.

In this paper, we present Make-An-Agent, a novel policy parameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation. Guided by behavior embeddings that encode trajectory information, our policy generator synthesizes latent parameter representations, which can then be decoded into policy networks. Trained on policy network checkpoints and their corresponding trajectories, our generation model demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and has a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed policies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs. We showcase its efficacy and efficiency on various domains and tasks, including varying objectives, behaviors, and even across different robot manipulators. Beyond simulation, we directly deploy policies generated by Make-An-Agent onto real-world robots on locomotion tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10973</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10973</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 02:07:46 GMT</pubDate><author>Yongyuan Liang, Tingqiang Xu, Kaizhe Hu, Guangqi Jiang, Furong Huang, Huazhe Xu</author></item><item><title>Noise Calibration: Plug-and-play Content-Preserving Video Enhancement using Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models</title><description>In order to improve the quality of synthesized videos, currently, one predominant method involves retraining an expert diffusion model and then implementing a noising-denoising process for refinement. Despite the significant training costs, maintaining consistency of content between the original and enhanced videos remains a major challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel formulation that considers both visual quality and consistency of content. Consistency of content is ensured by a proposed loss function that maintains the structure of the input, while visual quality is improved by utilizing the denoising process of pretrained diffusion models. To address the formulated optimization problem, we have developed a plug-and-play noise optimization strategy, referred to as Noise Calibration. By refining the initial random noise through a few iterations, the content of original video can be largely preserved, and the enhancement effect demonstrates a notable improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10285</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10285</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 01:54:18 GMT</pubDate><author>Qinyu Yang, Haoxin Chen, Yong Zhang, Menghan Xia, Xiaodong Cun, Zhixun Su, Ying Shan</author></item><item><title>SHERL: Synthesizing High Accuracy and Efficient Memory for Resource-Limited Transfer Learning</title><description>Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has emerged as a flourishing research field for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks, greatly reducing trainable parameters while grappling with memory challenges during fine-tuning. To address it, memory-efficient series (METL) avoid backpropagating gradients through the large backbone. However, they compromise by exclusively relying on frozen intermediate outputs and limiting the exhaustive exploration of prior knowledge from pre-trained models. Moreover, the dependency and redundancy between cross-layer features are frequently overlooked, thereby submerging more discriminative representations and causing an inherent performance gap (vs. conventional PETL methods). Hence, we propose an innovative METL strategy called SHERL for resource-limited scenarios to decouple the entire adaptation into two successive and complementary processes. In the early route, intermediate outputs are consolidated via an anti-redundancy operation, enhancing their compatibility for subsequent interactions; thereby in the late route, utilizing minimal late pre-trained layers could alleviate the peak demand on memory overhead and regulate these fairly flexible features into more adaptive and powerful representations for new domains. Extensive ablations on vision-and-language and language-only tasks show that SHERL combines the strengths of both parameter and memory-efficient techniques, performing on-par or better across diverse architectures with lower memory during fine-tuning. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Paranioar/SHERL.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07523</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07523</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 01:39:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Haiwen Diao, Bo Wan, Xu Jia, Yunzhi Zhuge, Ying Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Long Chen</author></item><item><title>Video Occupancy Models</title><description>We introduce a new family of video prediction models designed to support downstream control tasks. We call these models Video Occupancy models (VOCs). VOCs operate in a compact latent space, thus avoiding the need to make predictions about individual pixels. Unlike prior latent-space world models, VOCs directly predict the discounted distribution of future states in a single step, thus avoiding the need for multistep roll-outs. We show that both properties are beneficial when building predictive models of video for use in downstream control.

We release a comprehensive suite of foundational and instruction-tuned language models, encompassing a parameter range from 0.5 to 72 billion, featuring dense models and a Mixture-of-Experts model. Qwen2 surpasses most prior open-weight models, including its predecessor Qwen1.5, and exhibits competitive performance relative to proprietary models across diverse benchmarks on language understanding, generation, multilingual proficiency, coding, mathematics, and reasoning.   The flagship model, Qwen2-72B, showcases remarkable performance: 84.2 on MMLU, 37.9 on GPQA, 64.6 on HumanEval, 89.5 on GSM8K, and 82.4 on BBH as a base language model. The instruction-tuned variant, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, attains 9.1 on MT-Bench, 48.1 on Arena-Hard, and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench. Moreover, Qwen2 demonstrates robust multilingual capabilities, proficient in approximately 30 languages, spanning English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and more, underscoring its versatility and global reach.   To foster community innovation and accessibility, we have made the Qwen2 model weights openly available on Hugging Face1 and ModelScope2, and the supplementary materials including example code on GitHub3. These platforms also include resources for quantization, fine-tuning, and deployment, facilitating a wide range of applications and research endeavors.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10671</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10671</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 01:24:43 GMT</pubDate><author>An Yang, Baosong Yang, Binyuan Hui, Bo Zheng, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Chengpeng Li, Chengyuan Li, Dayiheng Liu, Fei Huang, Guanting Dong, Haoran Wei, Huan Lin, Jialong Tang, Jialin Wang, Jian Yang, Jianhong Tu, Jianwei Zhang, Jianxin Ma, Jin Xu, Jingren Zhou, Jinze Bai, Jinzheng He, Junyang Lin, Kai Dang, Keming Lu, Keqin Chen, Kexin Yang, Mei Li, Mingfeng Xue, Na Ni, Pei Zhang, Peng Wang, Ru Peng, Rui Men, Ruize Gao, Runji Lin, Shijie Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Tianhang Zhu, Tianhao Li, Tianyu Liu, Wenbin Ge, Xiaodong Deng, Xiaohuan Zhou, Xingzhang Ren, Xinyu Zhang, Xipin Wei, Xuancheng Ren, Yang Fan, Yang Yao, Yichang Zhang, Yu Wan, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Zhenru Zhang, Zhihao Fan</author></item><item><title>The Good, The Bad, and The Greedy: Evaluation of LLMs Should Not Ignore Non-Determinism</title><description>Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often overlook non-determinism, typically focusing on a single output per example. This limits our understanding of LLM performance variability in real-world applications. Our study addresses this issue by exploring key questions about the performance differences between greedy decoding and sampling, identifying benchmarks&#39; consistency regarding non-determinism, and examining unique model behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we observe that greedy decoding generally outperforms sampling methods for most evaluated tasks. We also observe consistent performance across different LLM sizes and alignment methods, noting that alignment can reduce sampling variance. Moreover, our best-of-N sampling approach demonstrates that smaller LLMs can match or surpass larger models such as GPT-4-Turbo, highlighting the untapped potential of smaller LLMs. This research shows the importance of considering non-determinism in LLM evaluations and provides insights for future LLM development and evaluation.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10457</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10457</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:10:32 GMT</pubDate><author>Yifan Song, Guoyin Wang, Sujian Li, Bill Yuchen Lin</author></item></channel></rss>
