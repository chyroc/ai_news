Evaluating this ability comes with significant challenges: (i) limited coherence between multiple instructions, (ii) positional bias where the order of instructions affects model performance, and (iii) a lack of objectively verifiable tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate models&#39; abilities to follow multiple instructions through sequential instruction following (SIFo) tasks. In SIFo, the successful completion of multiple instructions is verifiable by examining only the final instruction. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following using four tasks (text modification, question answering, mathematics, and security rule following), each assessing different aspects of sequential instruction following. Our evaluation of popular LLMs, both closed-source and open-source, shows that more recent and larger models significantly outperform their older and smaller counterparts on the SIFo tasks, validating the benchmark&#39;s effectiveness. All models struggle with following sequences of instructions, hinting at an important lack of robustness of today&#39;s language models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19999</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19999</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 22:14:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Xinyi Chen, Baohao Liao, Jirui Qi, Panagiotis Eustratiadis, Christof Monz, Arianna Bisazza, Maarten de Rijke</author></item><item><title>ProgressGym: Alignment with a Millennium of Moral Progress</title><description>Frontier AI systems, including large language models (LLMs), hold increasing influence over the epistemology of human users. Such influence can reinforce prevailing societal values, potentially contributing to the lock-in of misguided moral beliefs and, consequently, the perpetuation of problematic moral practices on a broad scale. We introduce progress alignment as a technical solution to mitigate this imminent risk. Progress alignment algorithms learn to emulate the mechanics of human moral progress, thereby addressing the susceptibility of existing alignment methods to contemporary moral blindspots. To empower research in progress alignment, we introduce ProgressGym, an experimental framework allowing the learning of moral progress mechanics from history, in order to facilitate future progress in real-world moral decisions. Leveraging 9 centuries of historical text and 18 historical LLMs, ProgressGym enables codification of real-world progress alignment challenges into concrete benchmarks. Specifically, we introduce three core challenges: tracking evolving values (PG-Follow), preemptively anticipating moral progress (PG-Predict), and regulating the feedback loop between human and AI value shifts (PG-Coevolve). Alignment methods without a temporal dimension are inapplicable to these tasks. In response, we present lifelong and extrapolative algorithms as baseline methods of progress alignment, and build an open leaderboard soliciting novel algorithms and challenges. The framework and the leaderboard are available at https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/ProgressGym and https://huggingface.co/spaces/PKU-Alignment/ProgressGym-LeaderBoard respectively.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20087</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20087</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:48:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Tianyi Qiu, Yang Zhang, Xuchuan Huang, Jasmine Xinze Li, Jiaming Ji, Yaodong Yang</author></item><item><title>RealTalk: Real-time and Realistic Audio-driven Face Generation with 3D Facial Prior-guided Identity Alignment Network</title><description>Person-generic audio-driven face generation is a challenging task in computer vision. Previous methods have achieved remarkable progress in audio-visual synchronization, but there is still a significant gap between current results and practical applications. The challenges are two-fold: 1) Preserving unique individual traits for achieving high-precision lip synchronization. 2) Generating high-quality facial renderings in real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized audio-driven framework RealTalk, which consists of an audio-to-expression transformer and a high-fidelity expression-to-face renderer. In the first component, we consider both identity and intra-personal variation features related to speaking lip movements. By incorporating cross-modal attention on the enriched facial priors, we can effectively align lip movements with audio, thus attaining greater precision in expression prediction. In the second component, we design a lightweight facial identity alignment (FIA) module which includes a lip-shape control structure and a face texture reference structure. This novel design allows us to generate fine details in real-time, without depending on sophisticated and inefficient feature alignment modules. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, on public datasets demonstrate the clear advantages of our method in terms of lip-speech synchronization and generation quality. Furthermore, our method is efficient and requires fewer computational resources, making it well-suited to meet the needs of practical applications.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18284</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18284</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 14:32:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Xiaozhong Ji, Chuming Lin, Zhonggan Ding, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Junwei Zhu, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Donghao Luo, Chengjie Wang</author></item><item><title>Token Erasure as a Footprint of Implicit Vocabulary Items in LLMs</title><description>LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b&#39;s tokenizer splits the word &quot;northeastern&quot; into the tokens [&#39;_n&#39;, &#39;ort&#39;, &#39;he&#39;, &#39;astern&#39;], none of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like &quot;north&quot; or &quot;east.&quot; Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like &quot;Neil Young&quot; and multi-word expressions like &quot;break a leg&quot; cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced &quot;erasure&quot; effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to &quot;read out&quot; the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20086</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20086</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 14:17:12 GMT</pubDate><author>Sheridan Feucht, David Atkinson, Byron Wallace, David Bau</author></item><item><title>Is It Really Long Context if All You Need Is Retrieval? Towards Genuinely Difficult Long Context NLP</title><description>Improvements in language models&#39; capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of &quot;long-context&quot;, defined simply by the total length of the model&#39;s input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00402</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00402</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 13:59:11 GMT</pubDate><author>Omer Goldman, Alon Jacovi, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Ido Dagan, Reut Tsarfaty</author></item><item><title>T-MAC: CPU Renaissance via Table Lookup for Low-Bit LLM Deployment on Edge</title><description>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important to enhance on-device intelligence. Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead.   In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution.   Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency. The system is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/T-MAC.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00088</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00088</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 13:12:34 GMT</pubDate><author>Jianyu Wei, Shijie Cao, Ting Cao, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Yanyong Zhang, Mao Yang</author></item><item><title>ROS-LLM: A ROS framework for embodied AI with task feedback and structured reasoning</title><description>We present a framework for intuitive robot programming by non-experts, leveraging natural language prompts and contextual information from the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our system integrates large language models (LLMs), enabling non-experts to articulate task requirements to the system through a chat interface. Key features of the framework include: integration of ROS with an AI agent connected to a plethora of open-source and commercial LLMs, automatic extraction of a behavior from the LLM output and execution of ROS actions/services, support for three behavior modes (sequence, behavior tree, state machine), imitation learning for adding new robot actions to the library of possible actions, and LLM reflection via human and environment feedback. Extensive experiments validate the framework, showcasing robustness, scalability, and versatility in diverse scenarios, including long-horizon tasks, tabletop rearrangements, and remote supervisory control. To facilitate the adoption of our framework and support the reproduction of our results, we have made our code open-source.

We achieved accurate predictions for a range of affinity values associated with ligand-protein interactions on out-of-sample data in a zero-shot setting. Only the SMILES string of the ligand and the amino acid sequence of the protein were used as the model inputs. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over machine learning (ML) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+) based methods in accurately predicting a range of ligand-protein interaction affinities, which can be leveraged to further accelerate drug discovery campaigns against challenging therapeutic targets.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00111</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00111</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 11:50:38 GMT</pubDate><author>Ben Fauber</author></item><item><title>Auto Cherry-Picker: Learning from High-quality Generative Data Driven by Language</title><description>Diffusion-based models have shown great potential in generating high-quality images with various layouts, which can benefit downstream perception tasks. However, a fully automatic layout generation driven only by language and a suitable metric for measuring multiple generated instances has not been well explored. In this work, we present Auto Cherry-Picker (ACP), a novel framework that generates high-quality multi-modal training examples to augment perception and multi-modal training. Starting with a simple list of natural language concepts, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate a detailed description and design reasonable layouts. Next, we use an off-the-shelf text-to-image model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric to ensure quality. In particular, we present a new metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to evaluate the generated images fairly. Our synthetic high-quality examples boost performance in various scenarios by customizing the initial concept list, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that Auto Cherry-Picker can significantly improve the performance of existing models. In addition, we have thoroughly investigated the correlation between CLIS and performance gains in downstream tasks, and we find that a better CLIS score results in better performance. This finding shows the potential for evaluation metrics as the role for various visual perception and MLLM tasks. Code will be available.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20085</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20085</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 09:05:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Yicheng Chen, Xiangtai Li, Yining Li, Yanhong Zeng, Jianzong Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Kai Chen</author></item><item><title>Show Less, Instruct More: Enriching Prompts with Definitions and Guidelines for Zero-Shot NER</title><description>Recently, several specialized instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) have emerged. Compared to traditional NER approaches, these models have strong generalization capabilities. Existing LLMs mainly focus on zero-shot NER in out-of-domain distributions, being fine-tuned on an extensive number of entity classes that often highly or completely overlap with test sets. In this work instead, we propose SLIMER, an approach designed to tackle never-seen-before named entity tags by instructing the model on fewer examples, and by leveraging a prompt enriched with definition and guidelines. Experiments demonstrate that definition and guidelines yield better performance, faster and more robust learning, particularly when labelling unseen Named Entities. Furthermore, SLIMER performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches in out-of-domain zero-shot NER, while being trained on a reduced tag set.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01272</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01272</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 07:32:55 GMT</pubDate><author>Andrew Zamai, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Ernandes, Marco Maggini</author></item><item><title>InstantStyle-Plus: Style Transfer with Content-Preserving in Text-to-Image Generation</title><description>Style transfer is an inventive process designed to create an image that maintains the essence of the original while embracing the visual style of another. Although diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative power in personalized subject-driven or style-driven applications, existing state-of-the-art methods still encounter difficulties in achieving a seamless balance between content preservation and style enhancement. For example, amplifying the style&#39;s influence can often undermine the structural integrity of the content. To address these challenges, we deconstruct the style transfer task into three core elements: 1) Style, focusing on the image&#39;s aesthetic characteristics; 2) Spatial Structure, concerning the geometric arrangement and composition of visual elements; and 3) Semantic Content, which captures the conceptual meaning of the image. Guided by these principles, we introduce InstantStyle-Plus, an approach that prioritizes the integrity of the original content while seamlessly integrating the target style. Specifically, our method accomplishes style injection through an efficient, lightweight process, utilizing the cutting-edge InstantStyle framework. To reinforce the content preservation, we initiate the process with an inverted content latent noise and a versatile plug-and-play tile ControlNet for preserving the original image&#39;s intrinsic layout. We also incorporate a global semantic adapter to enhance the semantic content&#39;s fidelity. To safeguard against the dilution of style information, a style extractor is employed as discriminator for providing supplementary style guidance. Codes will be available at https://github.com/instantX-research/InstantStyle-Plus.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00788</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00788</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 07:28:04 GMT</pubDate><author>Haofan Wang, Peng Xing, Renyuan Huang, Hao Ai, Qixun Wang, Xu Bai</author></item><item><title>OmniJARVIS: Unified Vision-Language-Action Tokenization Enables Open-World Instruction Following Agents</title><description>We present OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in open-world Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories tau = {o_0, a_0, dots} and an imitation learning (IL) policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc. into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the IL policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00114</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00114</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 07:13:55 GMT</pubDate><author>Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Zhancun Mu, Haowei Lin, Ceyao Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Qing Li, Anji Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang</author></item><item><title>Chain-of-Knowledge: Integrating Knowledge Reasoning into Large Language Models by Learning from Knowledge Graphs</title><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which involve increasingly complex reasoning. Knowledge reasoning, a primary type of reasoning, aims at deriving new knowledge from existing one.While it has been widely studied in the context of knowledge graphs (KGs), knowledge reasoning in LLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Knowledge, a comprehensive framework for knowledge reasoning, including methodologies for both dataset construction and model learning. For dataset construction, we create KnowReason via rule mining on KGs. For model learning, we observe rule overfitting induced by naive training. Hence, we enhance CoK with a trial-and-error mechanism that simulates the human process of internal knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments with KnowReason. Our results show the effectiveness of CoK in refining LLMs in not only knowledge reasoning, but also general reasoning benchmarkms.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00653</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00653</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 07:10:58 GMT</pubDate><author>Yifei Zhang, Xintao Wang, Jiaqing Liang, Sirui Xia, Lida Chen, Yanghua Xiao</author></item><item><title>Wavelets Are All You Need for Autoregressive Image Generation</title><description>In this paper, we take a new approach to autoregressive image generation that is based on two main ingredients. The first is wavelet image coding, which allows to tokenize the visual details of an image from coarse to fine details by ordering the information starting with the most significant bits of the most significant wavelet coefficients. The second is a variant of a language transformer whose architecture is re-designed and optimized for token sequences in this &#39;wavelet language&#39;. The transformer learns the significant statistical correlations within a token sequence, which are the manifestations of well-known correlations between the wavelet subbands at various resolutions. We show experimental results with conditioning on the generation process.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19997</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19997</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 07:03:55 GMT</pubDate><author>Wael Mattar, Idan Levy, Nir Sharon, Shai Dekel</author></item><item><title>UnUnlearning: Unlearning is not sufficient for content regulation in advanced generative AI</title><description>Exact unlearning was first introduced as a privacy mechanism that allowed a user to retract their data from machine learning models on request. Shortly after, inexact schemes were proposed to mitigate the impractical costs associated with exact unlearning. More recently unlearning is often discussed as an approach for removal of impermissible knowledge i.e. knowledge that the model should not possess such as unlicensed copyrighted, inaccurate, or malicious information. The promise is that if the model does not have a certain malicious capability, then it cannot be used for the associated malicious purpose. In this paper we revisit the paradigm in which unlearning is used for in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlight an underlying inconsistency arising from in-context learning. Unlearning can be an effective control mechanism for the training phase, yet it does not prevent the model from performing an impermissible act during inference. We introduce a concept of ununlearning, where unlearned knowledge gets reintroduced in-context, effectively rendering the model capable of behaving as if it knows the forgotten knowledge. As a result, we argue that content filtering for impermissible knowledge will be required and even exact unlearning schemes are not enough for effective content regulation. We discuss feasibility of ununlearning for modern LLMs and examine broader implications.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00106</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00106</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 06:22:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Eleni Triantafillou, Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Nicolas Papernot, Matthew Jagielski, Itay Yona, Heidi Howard, Eugene Bagdasaryan</author></item><item><title>DogeRM: Equipping Reward Models with Domain Knowledge through Model Merging</title><description>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular strategy for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviors. Reward modeling is a crucial step in RLHF. However, collecting paired preference data for training reward models is often costly and time-consuming, especially for domain-specific preferences requiring expert annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Domain knowledge merged Reward Model (DogeRM), a novel framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into a general reward model by model merging. The experiments demonstrate that DogeRM enhances performance across different benchmarks and provide a detailed analysis showcasing the effects of model merging, showing the great potential of facilitating model alignment.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01470</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01470</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 06:16:03 GMT</pubDate><author>Tzu-Han Lin, Chen-An Li, Hung-yi Lee, Yun-Nung Chen</author></item><item><title>ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models</title><description>Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, as well as tables, figures, page layouts, or fonts. While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages.

However, models are still far from supporting the world&#39;s 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT 2.0 v2 by 0.8% and 4.4% respectively, despite having less parameters or pre-training data.

We propose a pose-free and training-free approach for generating 3D stereoscopic videos using an off-the-shelf monocular video generation model. Our method warps a generated monocular video into camera views on stereoscopic baseline using estimated video depth, and employs a novel frame matrix video inpainting framework. The framework leverages the video generation model to inpaint frames observed from different timestamps and views. This effective approach generates consistent and semantically coherent stereoscopic videos without scene optimization or model fine-tuning. Moreover, we develop a disocclusion boundary re-injection scheme that further improves the quality of video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from disoccluded areas in the latent space. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting experiments on videos from various generative models, including Sora [4 ], Lumiere [2], WALT [8 ], and Zeroscope [ 42]. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a significant improvement over previous methods.

In this work, we propose Step-Controlled DPO (SCDPO), a method for automatically providing stepwise error supervision by creating negative samples of mathematical reasoning rationales that start making errors at a specified step. By applying these samples in DPO training, SCDPO can better align the model to understand reasoning errors and output accurate reasoning steps. We apply SCDPO to both code-integrated and chain-of-thought solutions, empirically showing that it consistently improves the performance compared to naive DPO on three different SFT models, including one existing SFT model and two models we finetuned. Qualitative analysis of the credit assignment of SCDPO and DPO demonstrates the effectiveness of SCDPO at identifying errors in mathematical solutions. We then apply SCDPO to an InternLM2-20B model, resulting in a 20B model that achieves high scores of 88.5% on GSM8K and 58.1% on MATH, rivaling all other open-source LLMs, showing the great potential of our method.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00782</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00782</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 02:14:17 GMT</pubDate><author>Zimu Lu, Aojun Zhou, Ke Wang, Houxing Ren, Weikang Shi, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan</author></item><item><title>RegMix: Data Mixture as Regression for Language Model Pre-training</title><description>The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training a set of small models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict their performance given their respective mixtures. With the fitted regression model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens of different mixtures to fit the regression model and find the optimal mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing only 10% of the compute budget. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance variations of up to 14.6%; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the complexity by considering all domains together.

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8times super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

However, they often require more than 10 times the computational resources of greedy decoding due to wasteful search strategies, making them difficult to be deployed in practical applications. This study introduces a novel guided tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and node-level exploration budget (maximum number of children) calculation to tackle this issue. By considering the search progress towards the final answer (history) and the guidance from a value network (future) trained without any step-wise annotations, our algorithm iteratively selects the most promising tree node before expanding it within the boundaries of the allocated computational budget. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets demonstrate that our approach not only offers competitive performance but also enjoys significantly lower computational costs compared to baseline methods.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00320</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00320</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 01:47:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Baolin Peng, Dian Yu, Haitao Mi, Jinsong Su, Dong Yu</author></item><item><title>MIRAI: Evaluating LLM Agents for Event Forecasting</title><description>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems. Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale. Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents&#39; forecasting capability and reliability. To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events. Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles. We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents&#39; abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting. We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents&#39; capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01231</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01231</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 01:22:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Chenchen Ye, Ziniu Hu, Yihe Deng, Zijie Huang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanqiao Zhu, Wei Wang</author></item><item><title>E2 TTS: Embarrassingly Easy Fully Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot TTS</title><description>This paper introduces Embarrassingly Easy Text-to-Speech (E2 TTS), a fully non-autoregressive zero-shot text-to-speech system that offers human-level naturalness and state-of-the-art speaker similarity and intelligibility. In the E2 TTS framework, the text input is converted into a character sequence with filler tokens. The flow-matching-based mel spectrogram generator is then trained based on the audio infilling task. Unlike many previous works, it does not require additional components (e.g., duration model, grapheme-to-phoneme) or complex techniques (e.g., monotonic alignment search). Despite its simplicity, E2 TTS achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS capabilities that are comparable to or surpass previous works, including Voicebox and NaturalSpeech 3. The simplicity of E2 TTS also allows for flexibility in the input representation. We propose several variants of E2 TTS to improve usability during inference.

However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises 2,138 question triplets, totaling 6,414 distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by 31.73%, compared to an average gap of 8.03% in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by 23.09%, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just 14.64%). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00468</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00468</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:11:05 GMT</pubDate><author>Jinsheng Huang, Liang Chen, Taian Guo, Fu Zeng, Yusheng Zhao, Bohan Wu, Ye Yuan, Haozhe Zhao, Zhihui Guo, Yichi Zhang, Jingyang Yuan, Wei Ju, Luchen Liu, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang, Ming Zhang</author></item><item><title>We-Math: Does Your Large Multimodal Model Achieve Human-like Mathematical Reasoning?</title><description>Visual mathematical reasoning, as a fundamental visual reasoning ability, has received widespread attention from the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) community. Existing benchmarks, such as MathVista and MathVerse, focus more on the result-oriented performance but neglect the underlying principles in knowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond end-to-end performance. We meticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and five layers of knowledge granularity. We decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM), to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs&#39; reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving steps and problem-specific performance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation strategies. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization - they correctly solve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts yet fail to answer sub-problems. We anticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for advancements in visual mathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01284</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01284</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:09:36 GMT</pubDate><author>Runqi Qiao, Qiuna Tan, Guanting Dong, Minhui Wu, Chong Sun, Xiaoshuai Song, Zhuoma GongQue, Shanglin Lei, Zhe Wei, Miaoxuan Zhang, Runfeng Qiao, Yifan Zhang, Xiao Zong, Yida Xu, Muxi Diao, Zhimin Bao, Chen Li, Honggang Zhang</author></item></channel></rss>
