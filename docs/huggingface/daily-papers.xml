In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM&#39;s superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM&#39;s event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 01:10:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Zafeirios Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang</author></item><item><title>MUSCLE: A Model Update Strategy for Compatible LLM Evolution</title><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated due to data or architecture changes to improve their performance. When updating models, developers often focus on increasing overall performance metrics with less emphasis on being compatible with previous model versions. However, users often build a mental model of the functionality and capabilities of a particular machine learning model they are interacting with. They have to adapt their mental model with every update -- a draining task that can lead to user dissatisfaction. In practice, fine-tuned downstream task adapters rely on pretrained LLM base models. When these base models are updated, these user-facing downstream task models experience instance regression or negative flips -- previously correct instances are now predicted incorrectly. This happens even when the downstream task training procedures remain identical. Our work aims to provide seamless model updates to a user in two ways. First, we provide evaluation metrics for a notion of compatibility to prior model versions, specifically for generative tasks but also applicable for discriminative tasks. We observe regression and inconsistencies between different model versions on a diverse set of tasks and model updates. Second, we propose a training strategy to minimize the number of inconsistencies in model updates, involving training of a compatibility model that can enhance task fine-tuned language models. We reduce negative flips -- instances where a prior model version was correct, but a new model incorrect -- by up to 40% from Llama 1 to Llama 2.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09435</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09435</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 01:08:51 GMT</pubDate><author>Jessica Echterhoff, Fartash Faghri, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Ting-Yao Hu, Chun-Liang Li, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari</author></item><item><title>GAVEL: Generating Games Via Evolution and Language Models</title><description>Automatically generating novel and interesting games is a complex task. Challenges include representing game rules in a computationally workable form, searching through the large space of potential games under most such representations, and accurately evaluating the originality and quality of previously unseen games. Prior work in automated game generation has largely focused on relatively restricted rule representations and relied on domain-specific heuristics. In this work, we explore the generation of novel games in the comparatively expansive Ludii game description language, which encodes the rules of over 1000 board games in a variety of styles and modes of play. We draw inspiration from recent advances in large language models and evolutionary computation in order to train a model that intelligently mutates and recombines games and mechanics expressed as code. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our approach is capable of generating new and interesting games, including in regions of the potential rules space not covered by existing games in the Ludii dataset. A sample of the generated games are available to play online through the Ludii portal.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09388</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09388</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 01:04:03 GMT</pubDate><author>Graham Todd, Alexander Padula, Matthew Stephenson, Éric Piette, Dennis J.

We aim to better understand the impact of removing or reorganizing information throughout the layers of a pretrained transformer. Such an understanding could both yield better usage of existing models as well as to make architectural improvements to produce new variants. We present a series of empirical studies on frozen models that show that the lower and final layers of pretrained transformers differ from middle layers, but that middle layers have a surprising amount of uniformity. We further show that some classes of problems have robustness to skipping layers, running the layers in an order different from how they were trained, or running the layers in parallel. Our observations suggest that even frozen pretrained models may gracefully trade accuracy for latency by skipping layers or running layers in parallel.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09298</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09298</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 01:00:23 GMT</pubDate><author>Qi Sun, Marc Pickett, Aakash Kumar Nain, Llion Jones</author></item><item><title>H2O-Danube3 Technical Report</title><description>We present H2O-Danube3, a series of small language models consisting of H2O-Danube3-4B, trained on 6T tokens and H2O-Danube3-500M, trained on 4T tokens. Our models are pre-trained on high quality Web data consisting of primarily English tokens in three stages with different data mixes before final supervised tuning for chat version. The models exhibit highly competitive metrics across a multitude of academic, chat, and fine-tuning benchmarks. Thanks to its compact architecture, H2O-Danube3 can be efficiently run on a modern smartphone, enabling local inference and rapid processing capabilities even on mobile devices.

In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs&#39; powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs&#39; token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4&#39;s in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, but achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09025</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09025</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:53:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Yuzhang Tian, Jianbo Zhao, Haoyu Dong, Junyu Xiong, Shiyu Xia, Mengyu Zhou, Yun Lin, José Cambronero, Yeye He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang</author></item><item><title>Understanding Retrieval Robustness for Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning</title><description>Recent advances in retrieval-augmented models for image captioning highlight the benefit of retrieving related captions for efficient, lightweight models with strong domain-transfer capabilities. While these models demonstrate the success of retrieval augmentation, retrieval models are still far from perfect in practice: the retrieved information can sometimes mislead the model, resulting in incorrect generation and worse performance. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of a retrieval-augmented captioning model SmallCap. Our analysis shows that the model is sensitive to tokens that appear in the majority of the retrieved captions, and the input attribution shows that those tokens are likely copied into the generated output. Given these findings, we propose to train the model by sampling retrieved captions from more diverse sets. This decreases the chance that the model learns to copy majority tokens, and improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02265</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02265</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:49:17 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenyan Li, Jiaang Li, Rita Ramos, Raphael Tang, Desmond Elliott</author></item><item><title>StyleSplat: 3D Object Style Transfer with Gaussian Splatting</title><description>Recent advancements in radiance fields have opened new avenues for creating high-quality 3D assets and scenes. Style transfer can enhance these 3D assets with diverse artistic styles, transforming creative expression. However, existing techniques are often slow or unable to localize style transfer to specific objects. We introduce StyleSplat, a lightweight method for stylizing 3D objects in scenes represented by 3D Gaussians from reference style images. Our approach first learns a photorealistic representation of the scene using 3D Gaussian splatting while jointly segmenting individual 3D objects. We then use a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the selected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style image to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick, customizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects within a scene, each with a different style. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various 3D scenes and styles, showcasing enhanced control and customization in 3D creation.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09473</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09473</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:46:24 GMT</pubDate><author>Sahil Jain, Avik Kuthiala, Prabhdeep Singh Sethi, Prakanshul Saxena</author></item><item><title>TCAN: Animating Human Images with Temporally Consistent Pose Guidance using Diffusion Models</title><description>Pose-driven human-image animation diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in realistic human video synthesis. Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.
