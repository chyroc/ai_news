An exciting development in this space is models boasting extended context capabilities, with some accommodating over 2 million tokens. Such long context model capabilities remain uncertain in production systems, motivating the need to benchmark their performance on real world use cases. We address this challenge by proposing SWiM, an evaluation framework that addresses the limitations of standard tests. Testing the framework on eight long context models, we find that even strong models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus degrade in performance when information is present in the middle of the context window (lost-in-the-middle effect). Next, in addition to our benchmark, we propose medoid voting, a simple, but effective training-free approach that helps alleviate this effect, by generating responses a few times, each time randomly permuting documents in the context, and selecting the medoid answer. We evaluate medoid voting on single document QA tasks, achieving up to a 24% lift in accuracy.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03651</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03651</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 17:00:28 GMT</pubDate><author>Amanda Dsouza, Christopher Glaze, Changho Shin, Frederic Sala</author></item><item><title>Learning Action and Reasoning-Centric Image Editing from Videos and Simulations</title><description>An image editing model should be able to perform diverse edits, ranging from object replacement, changing attributes or style, to performing actions or movement, which require many forms of reasoning. Current general instruction-guided editing models have significant shortcomings with action and reasoning-centric edits. Object, attribute or stylistic changes can be learned from visually static datasets. On the other hand, high-quality data for action and reasoning-centric edits is scarce and has to come from entirely different sources that cover e.g. physical dynamics, temporality and spatial reasoning. To this end, we meticulously curate the AURORA Dataset (Action-Reasoning-Object-Attribute), a collection of high-quality training data, human-annotated and curated from videos and simulation engines. We focus on a key aspect of quality training data: triplets (source image, prompt, target image) contain a single meaningful visual change described by the prompt, i.e., truly minimal changes between source and target images. To demonstrate the value of our dataset, we evaluate an AURORA-finetuned model on a new expert-curated benchmark (AURORA-Bench) covering 8 diverse editing tasks. Our model significantly outperforms previous editing models as judged by human raters. For automatic evaluations, we find important flaws in previous metrics and caution their use for semantically hard editing tasks. Instead, we propose a new automatic metric that focuses on discriminative understanding. We hope that our efforts : (1) curating a quality training dataset and an evaluation benchmark, (2) developing critical evaluations, and (3) releasing a state-of-the-art model, will fuel further progress on general image editing.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03471</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03471</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 16:46:23 GMT</pubDate><author>Benno Krojer, Dheeraj Vattikonda, Luis Lara, Varun Jampani, Eva Portelance, Christopher Pal, Siva Reddy</author></item><item><title>Training Task Experts through Retrieval Based Distillation</title><description>One of the most reliable ways to create deployable models for specialized tasks is to obtain an adequate amount of high-quality task-specific data. However, for specialized tasks, often such datasets do not exist. Existing methods address this by creating such data from large language models (LLMs) and then distilling such knowledge into smaller models. However, these methods are limited by the quality of the LLMs output, and tend to generate repetitive or incorrect data. In this work, we present Retrieval Based Distillation (ReBase), a method that first retrieves data from rich online sources and then transforms them into domain-specific data. This method greatly enhances data diversity. Moreover, ReBase generates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and distills the reasoning capacity of LLMs. We test our method on 4 benchmarks and results show that our method significantly improves performance by up to 7.8% on SQuAD, 1.37% on MNLI, and 1.94% on BigBench-Hard.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05463</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05463</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 14:53:13 GMT</pubDate><author>Jiaxin Ge, Xueying Jia, Vijay Viswanathan, Hongyin Luo, Graham Neubig</author></item><item><title>UltraEdit: Instruction-based Fine-Grained Image Editing at Scale</title><description>This paper presents UltraEdit, a large-scale (approximately 4 million editing samples), automatically generated dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our key idea is to address the drawbacks in existing image editing datasets like InstructPix2Pix and MagicBrush, and provide a systematic approach to producing massive and high-quality image editing samples. UltraEdit offers several distinct advantages: 1) It features a broader range of editing instructions by leveraging the creativity of large language models (LLMs) alongside in-context editing examples from human raters; 2) Its data sources are based on real images, including photographs and artworks, which provide greater diversity and reduced bias compared to datasets solely generated by text-to-image models; 3) It also supports region-based editing, enhanced by high-quality, automatically produced region annotations. Our experiments show that canonical diffusion-based editing baselines trained on UltraEdit set new records on MagicBrush and Emu-Edit benchmarks. Our analysis further confirms the crucial role of real image anchors and region-based editing data. The dataset, code, and models can be found in https://ultra-editing.github.io.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05282</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05282</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 14:35:46 GMT</pubDate><author>Haozhe Zhao, Xiaojian Ma, Liang Chen, Shuzheng Si, Rujie Wu, Kaikai An, Peiyu Yu, Minjia Zhang, Qing Li, Baobao Chang</author></item><item><title>Multi-Object Hallucination in Vision-Language Models</title><description>Large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, producing objects not present in the given images. While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously. We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1) LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2) The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations.(3) Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors. We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06192</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06192</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:56:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Xuweiyi Chen, Ziqiao Ma, Xuejun Zhang, Sihan Xu, Shengyi Qian, Jianing Yang, David F.

Our approach, Associative Recurrent Memory Transformer (ARMT), is based on transformer self-attention for local context and segment-level recurrence for storage of task specific information distributed over a long context. We demonstrate that ARMT outperfors existing alternatives in associative retrieval tasks and sets a new performance record in the recent BABILong multi-task long-context benchmark by answering single-fact questions over 50 million tokens with an accuracy of 79.9%.

Despite the promising results, a significant challenge remains: these models struggle to fully grasp complex compositional interactions between multiple concepts and actions. This issue arises when some words dominantly influence the final video, overshadowing other concepts.To tackle this problem, we introduce Vico, a generic framework for compositional video generation that explicitly ensures all concepts are represented properly. At its core, Vico analyzes how input tokens influence the generated video, and adjusts the model to prevent any single concept from dominating. Specifically, Vico extracts attention weights from all layers to build a spatial-temporal attention graph, and then estimates the influence as the max-flow from the source text token to the video target token. Although the direct computation of attention flow in diffusion models is typically infeasible, we devise an efficient approximation based on subgraph flows and employ a fast and vectorized implementation, which in turn makes the flow computation manageable and differentiable. By updating the noisy latent to balance these flows, Vico captures complex interactions and consequently produces videos that closely adhere to textual descriptions. We apply our method to multiple diffusion-based video models for compositional T2V and video editing. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the compositional richness and accuracy of the generated videos.

Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant. However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use. To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system. PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance. In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks. PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06027</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06027</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 08:44:11 GMT</pubDate><author>Miao Zheng, Hao Liang, Fan Yang, Haoze Sun, Tianpeng Li, Lingchu Xiong, Yan Zhang, Yozhen Wu, Kun Li, Yanjun Sheng, Mingan Lin, Tao Zhang, Guosheng Dong, Yujing Qiao, Kun Fang, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang, Zenan Zhou</author></item><item><title>PartCraft: Crafting Creative Objects by Parts</title><description>This paper propels creative control in generative visual AI by allowing users to &quot;select&quot;. Departing from traditional text or sketch-based methods, we for the first time allow users to choose visual concepts by parts for their creative endeavors. The outcome is fine-grained generation that precisely captures selected visual concepts, ensuring a holistically faithful and plausible result. To achieve this, we first parse objects into parts through unsupervised feature clustering. Then, we encode parts into text tokens and introduce an entropy-based normalized attention loss that operates on them. This loss design enables our model to learn generic prior topology knowledge about object&#39;s part composition, and further generalize to novel part compositions to ensure the generation looks holistically faithful. Lastly, we employ a bottleneck encoder to project the part tokens. This not only enhances fidelity but also accelerates learning, by leveraging shared knowledge and facilitating information exchange among instances. Visual results in the paper and supplementary material showcase the compelling power of PartCraft in crafting highly customized, innovative creations, exemplified by the &quot;charming&quot; and creative birds.

To mitigate these limitations, we present Anole, an open, autoregressive, native large multimodal model for interleaved image-text generation. We build Anole from Meta AI&#39;s Chameleon, adopting an innovative fine-tuning strategy that is both data-efficient and parameter-efficient. Anole demonstrates high-quality, coherent multimodal generation capabilities. We have open-sourced our model, training framework, and instruction tuning data.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06135</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06135</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 07:09:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Ethan Chern, Jiadi Su, Yan Ma, Pengfei Liu</author></item><item><title>MJ-Bench: Is Your Multimodal Reward Model Really a Good Judge for Text-to-Image Generation?</title><description>While text-to-image models like DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion are rapidly proliferating, they often encounter challenges such as hallucination, bias, and the production of unsafe, low-quality output. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial to align these models with desired behaviors based on feedback from a multimodal judge. Despite their significance, current multimodal judges frequently undergo inadequate evaluation of their capabilities and limitations, potentially leading to misalignment and unsafe fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce MJ-Bench, a novel benchmark which incorporates a comprehensive preference dataset to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across four key perspectives: alignment, safety, image quality, and bias. Specifically, we evaluate a large variety of multimodal judges including smaller-sized CLIP-based scoring models, open-source VLMs (e.g. LLaVA family), and close-source VLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3) on each decomposed subcategory of our preference dataset. Experiments reveal that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, with GPT-4o outperforming other judges in average. Compared with open-source VLMs, smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality, while VLMs provide more accurate feedback regarding safety and generation bias due to their stronger reasoning capabilities. Further studies in feedback scale reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language (Likert-scale) than numerical scales. Notably, human evaluations on end-to-end fine-tuned models using separate feedback from these multimodal judges provide similar conclusions, further confirming the effectiveness of MJ-Bench. All data, code, models are available at https://huggingface.co/MJ-Bench.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04842</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04842</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:57:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhaorun Chen, Yichao Du, Zichen Wen, Yiyang Zhou, Chenhang Cui, Zhenzhen Weng, Haoqin Tu, Chaoqi Wang, Zhengwei Tong, Qinglan Huang, Canyu Chen, Qinghao Ye, Zhihong Zhu, Yuqing Zhang, Jiawei Zhou, Zhuokai Zhao, Rafael Rafailov, Chelsea Finn, Huaxiu Yao</author></item><item><title>LLMAEL: Large Language Models are Good Context Augmenters for Entity Linking</title><description>Entity Linking (EL) models are well-trained at mapping mentions to their corresponding entities according to a given context. However, EL models struggle to disambiguate long-tail entities due to their limited training data. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) are more robust at interpreting uncommon mentions. Yet, due to a lack of specialized training, LLMs suffer at generating correct entity IDs. Furthermore, training an LLM to perform EL is cost-intensive. Building upon these insights, we introduce LLM-Augmented Entity Linking LLMAEL, a plug-and-play approach to enhance entity linking through LLM data augmentation. We leverage LLMs as knowledgeable context augmenters, generating mention-centered descriptions as additional input, while preserving traditional EL models for task specific processing. Experiments on 6 standard datasets show that the vanilla LLMAEL outperforms baseline EL models in most cases, while the fine-tuned LLMAEL set the new state-of-the-art results across all 6 benchmarks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04020</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04020</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:45:56 GMT</pubDate><author>Amy Xin, Yunjia Qi, Zijun Yao, Fangwei Zhu, Kaisheng Zeng, Xu Bin, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</author></item><item><title>InverseCoder: Unleashing the Power of Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs with Inverse-Instruct</title><description>Recent advancements in open-source code large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable coding abilities by fine-tuning on the data generated from powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for instruction tuning. This paper explores how to further improve an instruction-tuned code LLM by generating data from itself rather than querying closed-source LLMs. Our key observation is the misalignment between the translation of formal and informal languages: translating formal language (i.e., code) to informal language (i.e., natural language) is more straightforward than the reverse. Based on this observation, we propose INVERSE-INSTRUCT, which summarizes instructions from code snippets instead of the reverse. Specifically, given an instruction tuning corpus for code and the resulting instruction-tuned code LLM, we ask the code LLM to generate additional high-quality instructions for the original corpus through code summarization and self-evaluation. Then, we fine-tune the base LLM on the combination of the original corpus and the self-generated one, which yields a stronger instruction-tuned LLM. We present a series of code LLMs named InverseCoder, which surpasses the performance of the original code LLMs on a wide range of benchmarks, including Python text-to-code generation, multilingual coding, and data-science code generation.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05700</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05700</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:36:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Wenxuan Shi, Wei Wang, Lingzhe Gao, Shihao Liu, Ziyuan Nan, Kaizhao Yuan, Rui Zhang, Xishan Zhang, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Yewen Pu, Dawei Yin, Xing Hu, Yunji Chen</author></item><item><title>ANAH-v2: Scaling Analytical Hallucination Annotation of Large Language Models</title><description>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations in long-form question-answering tasks across various domains and wide applications. Current hallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and sizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient reliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable oversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative self-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the hallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination annotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the hallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language Inference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04693</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04693</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:14:54 GMT</pubDate><author>Yuzhe Gu, Ziwei Ji, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen</author></item><item><title>Tailor3D: Customized 3D Assets Editing and Generation with Dual-Side Images</title><description>Recent advances in 3D AIGC have shown promise in directly creating 3D objects from text and images, offering significant cost savings in animation and product design. However, detailed edit and customization of 3D assets remains a long-standing challenge. Specifically, 3D Generation methods lack the ability to follow finely detailed instructions as precisely as their 2D image creation counterparts. Imagine you can get a toy through 3D AIGC but with undesired accessories and dressing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline called Tailor3D, which swiftly creates customized 3D assets from editable dual-side images. We aim to emulate a tailor&#39;s ability to locally change objects or perform overall style transfer. Unlike creating 3D assets from multiple views, using dual-side images eliminates conflicts on overlapping areas that occur when editing individual views. Specifically, it begins by editing the front view, then generates the back view of the object through multi-view diffusion. Afterward, it proceeds to edit the back views. Finally, a Dual-sided LRM is proposed to seamlessly stitch together the front and back 3D features, akin to a tailor sewing together the front and back of a garment. The Dual-sided LRM rectifies imperfect consistencies between the front and back views, enhancing editing capabilities and reducing memory burdens while seamlessly integrating them into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA Triplane Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate Tailor3D&#39;s effectiveness across various 3D generation and editing tasks, including 3D generative fill and style transfer. It provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for editing 3D assets, with each editing step taking only seconds to complete.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06191</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06191</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 04:38:03 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhangyang Qi, Yunhan Yang, Mengchen Zhang, Long Xing, Xiaoyang Wu, Tong Wu, Dahua Lin, Xihui Liu, Jiaqi Wang, Hengshuang Zhao</author></item><item><title>LLaMAX: Scaling Linguistic Horizons of LLM by Enhancing Translation Capabilities Beyond 100 Languages</title><description>Large Language Models~(LLMs) demonstrate remarkable translation capabilities in high-resource language tasks, yet their performance in low-resource languages is hindered by insufficient multilingual data during pre-training. To address this, we dedicate 35,000 A100-SXM4-80GB GPU hours in conducting extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs~(by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model~(M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model.
