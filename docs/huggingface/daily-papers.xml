However, these methods all regard the temporal axis as a separate dimension of the video sequence, which requires large computation and memory budgets and thus limits their usage on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose to squeeze the time axis of a video sequence into the channel dimension and present a lightweight video recognition network, term as SqueezeTime, for mobile video understanding. To enhance the temporal modeling capability of the proposed network, we design a Channel-Time Learning (CTL) Block to capture temporal dynamics of the sequence. This module has two complementary branches, in which one branch is for temporal importance learning and another branch with temporal position restoring capability is to enhance inter-temporal object modeling ability. The proposed SqueezeTime is much lightweight and fast with high accuracies for mobile video understanding. Extensive experiments on various video recognition and action detection benchmarks, i.e., Kinetics400, Kinetics600, HMDB51, AVA2.1 and THUMOS14, demonstrate the superiority of our model. For example, our SqueezeTime achieves +1.2% accuracy and +80% GPU throughput gain on Kinetics400 than prior methods. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SqueezeTime and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SqueezeTime.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08344</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08344</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 18:19:10 GMT</pubDate><author>Yingjie Zhai, Wenshuo Li, Yehui Tang, Xinghao Chen, Yunhe Wang</author></item><item><title>Beyond Scaling Laws: Understanding Transformer Performance with Associative Memory</title><description>Increasing the size of a Transformer model does not always lead to enhanced performance. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the empirical scaling laws. Furthermore, improved generalization ability occurs as the model memorizes the training samples. We present a theoretical framework that sheds light on the memorization process and performance dynamics of transformer-based language models. We model the behavior of Transformers with associative memories using Hopfield networks, such that each transformer block effectively conducts an approximate nearest-neighbor search. Based on this, we design an energy function analogous to that in the modern continuous Hopfield network which provides an insightful explanation for the attention mechanism. Using the majorization-minimization technique, we construct a global energy function that captures the layered architecture of the Transformer. Under specific conditions, we show that the minimum achievable cross-entropy loss is bounded from below by a constant approximately equal to 1. We substantiate our theoretical results by conducting experiments with GPT-2 on various data sizes, as well as training vanilla Transformers on a dataset of 2M tokens.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08707</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08707</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 18:12:54 GMT</pubDate><author>Xueyan Niu, Bo Bai, Lei Deng, Wei Han</author></item><item><title>Understanding the performance gap between online and offline alignment algorithms</title><description>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the canonical framework for large language model alignment. However, rising popularity in offline alignment algorithms challenge the need for on-policy sampling in RLHF. Within the context of reward over-optimization, we start with an opening set of experiments that demonstrate the clear advantage of online methods over offline methods. This prompts us to investigate the causes to the performance discrepancy through a series of carefully designed experimental ablations. We show empirically that hypotheses such as offline data coverage and data quality by itself cannot convincingly explain the performance difference. We also find that while offline algorithms train policy to become good at pairwise classification, it is worse at generations; in the meantime the policies trained by online algorithms are good at generations while worse at pairwise classification. This hints at a unique interplay between discriminative and generative capabilities, which is greatly impacted by the sampling process. Lastly, we observe that the performance discrepancy persists for both contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions, and appears not to be addressed by simply scaling up policy networks. Taken together, our study sheds light on the pivotal role of on-policy sampling in AI alignment, and hints at certain fundamental challenges of offline alignment algorithms.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08448</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08448</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 18:09:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Yunhao Tang, Daniel Zhaohan Guo, Zeyu Zheng, Daniele Calandriello, Yuan Cao, Eugene Tarassov, Rémi Munos, Bernardo Ávila Pires, Michal Valko, Yong Cheng, Will Dabney</author></item><item><title>SpeechGuard: Exploring the Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models</title><description>Integrated Speech and Large Language Models (SLMs) that can follow speech instructions and generate relevant text responses have gained popularity lately. However, the safety and robustness of these models remains largely unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of such instruction-following speech-language models to adversarial attacks and jailbreaking. Specifically, we design algorithms that can generate adversarial examples to jailbreak SLMs in both white-box and black-box attack settings without human involvement. Additionally, we propose countermeasures to thwart such jailbreaking attacks. Our models, trained on dialog data with speech instructions, achieve state-of-the-art performance on spoken question-answering task, scoring over 80% on both safety and helpfulness metrics. Despite safety guardrails, experiments on jailbreaking demonstrate the vulnerability of SLMs to adversarial perturbations and transfer attacks, with average attack success rates of 90% and 10% respectively when evaluated on a dataset of carefully designed harmful questions spanning 12 different toxic categories. However, we demonstrate that our proposed countermeasures reduce the attack success significantly.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08317</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08317</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 18:05:32 GMT</pubDate><author>Raghuveer Peri, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Srikanth Ronanki, Anshu Bhatia, Karel Mundnich, Saket Dingliwal, Nilaksh Das, Zejiang Hou, Goeric Huybrechts, Srikanth Vishnubhotla, Daniel Garcia-Romero, Sundararajan Srinivasan, Kyu J Han, Katrin Kirchhoff</author></item><item><title>SpeechVerse: A Large-scale Generalizable Audio Language Model</title><description>Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible proficiency in performing tasks that require semantic understanding of natural language instructions. Recently, many works have further expanded this capability to perceive multimodal audio and text inputs, but their capabilities are often limited to specific fine-tuned tasks such as automatic speech recognition and translation. We therefore develop SpeechVerse, a robust multi-task training and curriculum learning framework that combines pre-trained speech and text foundation models via a small set of learnable parameters, while keeping the pre-trained models frozen during training. The models are instruction finetuned using continuous latent representations extracted from the speech foundation model to achieve optimal zero-shot performance on a diverse range of speech processing tasks using natural language instructions. We perform extensive benchmarking that includes comparing our model performance against traditional baselines across several datasets and tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the model&#39;s capability for generalized instruction following by testing on out-of-domain datasets, novel prompts, and unseen tasks. Our empirical experiments reveal that our multi-task SpeechVerse model is even superior to conventional task-specific baselines on 9 out of the 11 tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08295</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08295</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 18:00:15 GMT</pubDate><author>Nilaksh Das, Saket Dingliwal, Srikanth Ronanki, Rohit Paturi, David Huang, Prashant Mathur, Jie Yuan, Dhanush Bekal, Xing Niu, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Xilai Li, Karel Mundnich, Monica Sunkara, Sundararajan Srinivasan, Kyu J Han, Katrin Kirchhoff</author></item><item><title>Coin3D: Controllable and Interactive 3D Assets Generation with Proxy-Guided Conditioning</title><description>As humans, we aspire to create media content that is both freely willed and readily controlled. Thanks to the prominent development of generative techniques, we now can easily utilize 2D diffusion methods to synthesize images controlled by raw sketch or designated human poses, and even progressively edit/regenerate local regions with masked inpainting. However, similar workflows in 3D modeling tasks are still unavailable due to the lack of controllability and efficiency in 3D generation. In this paper, we present a novel controllable and interactive 3D assets modeling framework, named Coin3D. Coin3D allows users to control the 3D generation using a coarse geometry proxy assembled from basic shapes, and introduces an interactive generation workflow to support seamless local part editing while delivering responsive 3D object previewing within a few seconds. To this end, we develop several techniques, including the 3D adapter that applies volumetric coarse shape control to the diffusion model, proxy-bounded editing strategy for precise part editing, progressive volume cache to support responsive preview, and volume-SDS to ensure consistent mesh reconstruction. Extensive experiments of interactive generation and editing on diverse shape proxies demonstrate that our method achieves superior controllability and flexibility in the 3D assets generation task.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08054</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08054</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 16:18:07 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenqi Dong, Bangbang Yang, Lin Ma, Xiao Liu, Liyuan Cui, Hujun Bao, Yuewen Ma, Zhaopeng Cui</author></item><item><title>Hunyuan-DiT: A Powerful Multi-Resolution Diffusion Transformer with Fine-Grained Chinese Understanding</title><description>We present Hunyuan-DiT, a text-to-image diffusion transformer with fine-grained understanding of both English and Chinese. To construct Hunyuan-DiT, we carefully design the transformer structure, text encoder, and positional encoding. We also build from scratch a whole data pipeline to update and evaluate data for iterative model optimization. For fine-grained language understanding, we train a Multimodal Large Language Model to refine the captions of the images. Finally, Hunyuan-DiT can perform multi-turn multimodal dialogue with users, generating and refining images according to the context. Through our holistic human evaluation protocol with more than 50 professional human evaluators, Hunyuan-DiT sets a new state-of-the-art in Chinese-to-image generation compared with other open-source models.

In this work, we propose to decompose a scene into visual primitives - denoted as dense blob representations - that contain fine-grained details of the scene while being modular, human-interpretable, and easy-to-construct. Based on blob representations, we develop a blob-grounded text-to-image diffusion model, termed BlobGEN, for compositional generation. Particularly, we introduce a new masked cross-attention module to disentangle the fusion between blob representations and visual features. To leverage the compositionality of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a new in-context learning approach to generate blob representations from text prompts. Our extensive experiments show that BlobGEN achieves superior zero-shot generation quality and better layout-guided controllability on MS-COCO. When augmented by LLMs, our method exhibits superior numerical and spatial correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks.

However, Sora, as well as other text-to-video diffusion models, highly relies on the prompts, and there is no publicly available dataset featuring a study of text-to-video prompts. In this paper, we introduce VidProM, the first large-scale dataset comprising 1.67 million unique text-to-video prompts from real users. Additionally, the dataset includes 6.69 million videos generated by four state-of-the-art diffusion models and some related data. We initially demonstrate the curation of this large-scale dataset, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Subsequently, we show how the proposed VidProM differs from DiffusionDB, a large-scale prompt-gallery dataset for image generation. Based on the analysis of these prompts, we identify the necessity for a new prompt dataset specifically designed for text-to-video generation and gain insights into the preferences of real users when creating videos. Our large-scale and diverse dataset also inspires many exciting new research areas. For instance, to develop better, more efficient, and safer text-to-video diffusion models, we suggest exploring text-to-video prompt engineering, efficient video generation, and video copy detection for diffusion models. We make the collected dataset VidProM publicly available at GitHub and Hugging Face under the CC-BY- NC 4.0 License.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06098</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06098</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 14:28:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenhao Wang, Yi Yang</author></item></channel></rss>
