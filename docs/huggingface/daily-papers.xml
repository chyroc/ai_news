However, understanding long multimodal content, as a foundational ability for real-world applications, remains underexplored. In this work, we present Needle In A Multimodal Haystack (MM-NIAH), the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate the capability of existing MLLMs to comprehend long multimodal documents. Our benchmark includes three types of evaluation tasks: multimodal retrieval, counting, and reasoning. In each task, the model is required to answer the questions according to different key information scattered throughout the given multimodal document. Evaluating the leading MLLMs on MM-NIAH, we observe that existing models still have significant room for improvement on these tasks, especially on vision-centric evaluation. We hope this work can provide a platform for further research on long multimodal document comprehension and contribute to the advancement of MLLMs. Code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/MM-NIAH.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07230</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07230</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 04:32:27 GMT</pubDate><author>Weiyun Wang, Shuibo Zhang, Yiming Ren, Yuchen Duan, Tiantong Li, Shuo Liu, Mengkang Hu, Zhe Chen, Kaipeng Zhang, Lewei Lu, Xizhou Zhu, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai, Wenqi Shao, Wenhai Wang</author></item><item><title>Decoding the Diversity: A Review of the Indic AI Research Landscape</title><description>This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of large language model (LLM) research directions within Indic languages. Indic languages are those spoken in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan, among others. These languages have a rich cultural and linguistic heritage and are spoken by over 1.5 billion people worldwide. With the tremendous market potential and growing demand for natural language processing (NLP) based applications in diverse languages, generative applications for Indic languages pose unique challenges and opportunities for research. Our paper deep dives into the recent advancements in Indic generative modeling, contributing with a taxonomy of research directions, tabulating 84 recent publications. Research directions surveyed in this paper include LLM development, fine-tuning existing LLMs, development of corpora, benchmarking and evaluation, as well as publications around specific techniques, tools, and applications. We found that researchers across the publications emphasize the challenges associated with limited data availability, lack of standardization, and the peculiar linguistic complexities of Indic languages. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of NLP, particularly those focused on Indic languages, and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient LLM applications for these languages.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09559</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09559</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 03:54:15 GMT</pubDate><author>Sankalp KJ, Vinija Jain, Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Tamoghna Roy, Aman Chadha</author></item><item><title>Glyph-ByT5-v2: A Strong Aesthetic Baseline for Accurate Multilingual Visual Text Rendering</title><description>Recently, Glyph-ByT5 has achieved highly accurate visual text rendering performance in graphic design images. However, it still focuses solely on English and performs relatively poorly in terms of visual appeal. In this work, we address these two fundamental limitations by presenting Glyph-ByT5-v2 and Glyph-SDXL-v2, which not only support accurate visual text rendering for 10 different languages but also achieve much better aesthetic quality. To achieve this, we make the following contributions: (i) creating a high-quality multilingual glyph-text and graphic design dataset consisting of more than 1 million glyph-text pairs and 10 million graphic design image-text pairs covering nine other languages, (ii) building a multilingual visual paragraph benchmark consisting of 1,000 prompts, with 100 for each language, to assess multilingual visual spelling accuracy, and (iii) leveraging the latest step-aware preference learning approach to enhance the visual aesthetic quality. With the combination of these techniques, we deliver a powerful customized multilingual text encoder, Glyph-ByT5-v2, and a strong aesthetic graphic generation model, Glyph-SDXL-v2, that can support accurate spelling in 10 different languages. We perceive our work as a significant advancement, considering that the latest DALL-E3 and Ideogram 1.0 still struggle with the multilingual visual text rendering task.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10208</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10208</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 03:22:08 GMT</pubDate><author>Zeyu Liu, Weicong Liang, Yiming Zhao, Bohan Chen, Ji Li, Yuhui Yuan</author></item></channel></rss>
