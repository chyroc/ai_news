            <title><![CDATA[PanGu-$Ï€$: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[The recent trend of large language models (LLMs) is to increase the scale of both model size (\aka the number of parameters) and dataset to achieve better generative ability, which is definitely proved by a lot of work such as the famous GPT and Llama. However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-pi. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-pi with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-pi-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-pi-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-pi-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Gemini in Reasoning: Unveiling Commonsense in Multimodal Large Language Models]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[The burgeoning interest in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4V(ision), has significantly impacted both academic and industrial realms. These models enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced visual understanding capabilities, facilitating their application in a variety of multimodal tasks. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a cutting-edge MLLM designed specifically for multimodal integration. Despite its advancements, preliminary benchmarks indicate that Gemini lags behind GPT models in commonsense reasoning tasks. However, this assessment, based on a limited dataset (i.e., HellaSWAG), does not fully capture Gemini's authentic commonsense reasoning potential. To address this gap, our study undertakes a thorough evaluation of Gemini's performance in complex reasoning tasks that necessitate the integration of commonsense knowledge across modalities. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of 12 commonsense reasoning datasets, ranging from general to domain-specific tasks. This includes 11 datasets focused solely on language, as well as one that incorporates multimodal elements. Our experiments across four LLMs and two MLLMs demonstrate Gemini's competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we identify common challenges faced by current LLMs and MLLMs in addressing commonsense problems, underscoring the need for further advancements in enhancing the commonsense reasoning abilities of these models.]]></description>
