However, previous research demonstrated LLMs trained using domain-focused corpora perform better on specialized tasks. Inspired by this pivotal insight, we developed INDUS, a comprehensive suite of LLMs tailored for the Earth science, biology, physics, heliophysics, planetary sciences and astrophysics domains and trained using curated scientific corpora drawn from diverse data sources. The suite of models include: (1) an encoder model trained using domain-specific vocabulary and corpora to address natural language understanding tasks, (2) a contrastive-learning-based general text embedding model trained using a diverse set of datasets drawn from multiple sources to address information retrieval tasks and (3) smaller versions of these models created using knowledge distillation techniques to address applications which have latency or resource constraints. We also created three new scientific benchmark datasets namely, CLIMATE-CHANGE-NER (entity-recognition), NASA-QA (extractive QA) and NASA-IR (IR) to accelerate research in these multi-disciplinary fields. Finally, we show that our models outperform both general-purpose encoders (RoBERTa) and existing domain-specific encoders (SciBERT) on these new tasks as well as existing benchmark tasks in the domains of interest.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10725</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10725</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 15:14:00 GMT</pubDate><author>Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee, Aashka Trivedi, Masayasu Muraoka, Muthukumaran Ramasubramanian, Takuma Udagawa, Iksha Gurung, Rong Zhang, Bharath Dandala, Rahul Ramachandran, Manil Maskey, Kayleen Bugbee, Mike Little, Elizabeth Fancher, Lauren Sanders, Sylvain Costes, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma, Kelly Lockhart, Thomas Allen, Felix Grazes, Megan Ansdel, Alberto Accomazzi, Yousef El-Kurdi, Davis Wertheimer, Birgit Pfitzmann, Cesar Berrospi Ramis, Michele Dolfi, Rafael Teixeira de Lima, Panos Vegenas, S.

However, training LLMs for languages other than English poses significant challenges, due to the difficulty in acquiring large-scale corpus and the requisite computing resources. In this paper, we propose ChatFlow, a cross-language transfer-based LLM, to address these challenges and train large Chinese language models in a cost-effective manner. We employ a mix of Chinese, English, and parallel corpus to continuously train the LLaMA2 model, aiming to align cross-language representations and facilitate the knowledge transfer specifically to the Chinese language model. In addition, we use a dynamic data sampler to progressively transition the model from unsupervised pre-training to supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accelerates model convergence and achieves superior performance. We evaluate ChatFlow on popular Chinese and English benchmarks, the results indicate that it outperforms other Chinese models post-trained on LLaMA-2-7B.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10626</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10626</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 15:08:07 GMT</pubDate><author>Yudong Li, Yuhao Feng, Wen Zhou, Zhe Zhao, Linlin Shen, Cheng Hou, Xianxu Hou</author></item><item><title>Grounded 3D-LLM with Referent Tokens</title><description>Prior studies on 3D scene understanding have primarily developed specialized models for specific tasks or required task-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we propose Grounded 3D-LLM, which explores the potential of 3D large multi-modal models (3D LMMs) to consolidate various 3D vision tasks within a unified generative framework. The model uses scene referent tokens as special noun phrases to reference 3D scenes, enabling the handling of sequences that interleave 3D and textual data. It offers a natural approach for translating 3D vision tasks into language formats using task-specific instruction templates. To facilitate the use of referent tokens in subsequent language modeling, we have curated large-scale grounded language datasets that offer finer scene-text correspondence at the phrase level by bootstrapping existing object labels. Subsequently, we introduced Contrastive LAnguage-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to effectively leverage this data, thereby integrating 3D vision with language models. Our comprehensive evaluation covers open-ended tasks like dense captioning and 3D QA, alongside close-ended tasks such as object detection and language grounding. Experiments across multiple 3D benchmarks reveal the leading performance and the broad applicability of Grounded 3D-LLM. Code and datasets will be released on the project page: https://groundedscenellm.github.io/grounded_3d-llm.github.io.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10370</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10370</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 15:05:29 GMT</pubDate><author>Yilun Chen, Shuai Yang, Haifeng Huang, Tai Wang, Ruiyuan Lyu, Runsen Xu, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang</author></item><item><title>Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models</title><description>Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26times higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~80 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 14:57:17 GMT</pubDate><author>Yangjun Ruan, Chris J.
