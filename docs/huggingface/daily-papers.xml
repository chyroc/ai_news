In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs&#39; effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.

Current datasets and models for 3D visual grounding predominantly focus on identifying and localizing objects from static, object-centric descriptions. These approaches do not adequately address the dynamic and sequential nature of task-oriented grounding necessary for practical applications. In this work, we propose a new task: Task-oriented Sequential Grounding in 3D scenes, wherein an agent must follow detailed step-by-step instructions to complete daily activities by locating a sequence of target objects in indoor scenes. To facilitate this task, we introduce SG3D, a large-scale dataset containing 22,346 tasks with 112,236 steps across 4,895 real-world 3D scenes. The dataset is constructed using a combination of RGB-D scans from various 3D scene datasets and an automated task generation pipeline, followed by human verification for quality assurance. We adapted three state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding models to the sequential grounding task and evaluated their performance on SG3D. Our results reveal that while these models perform well on traditional benchmarks, they face significant challenges with task-oriented sequential grounding, underscoring the need for further research in this area.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04034</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04034</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:25:43 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhuofan Zhang, Ziyu Zhu, Pengxiang Li, Tengyu Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yixin Chen, Baoxiong Jia, Siyuan Huang, Qing Li</author></item><item><title>Puppet-Master: Scaling Interactive Video Generation as a Motion Prior for Part-Level Dynamics</title><description>We present Puppet-Master, an interactive video generative model that can serve as a motion prior for part-level dynamics. At test time, given a single image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories. Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark.
