Our approach does not assume access to any rigging or intermediate shape keyframes, produces geometrically and temporally consistent motions, and can be used to transfer long motion sequences. Central to our approach are two coupled neural networks that individually predict local geometric and temporal changes that are subsequently integrated, spatially and temporally, to produce the final animated meshes. The two networks are jointly trained, complement each other in producing spatial and temporal signals, and are supervised directly with 3D positional information. During inference, in the absence of keyframes, our method essentially solves a motion extrapolation problem. We test our setup on diverse meshes (synthetic and scanned shapes) to demonstrate its superiority in generating realistic and natural-looking animations on unseen body shapes against SoTA alternatives.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce NNsight, an open-source Python package with a simple, flexible API that can express interventions on any PyTorch model by building computation graphs. We also introduce NDIF, a collaborative research platform providing researchers access to foundation-scale LLMs via the NNsight API. Code, documentation, and tutorials are available at https://www.nnsight.net.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14561</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14561</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 01:18:00 GMT</pubDate><author>Jaden Fiotto-Kaufman, Alexander R Loftus, Eric Todd, Jannik Brinkmann, Caden Juang, Koyena Pal, Can Rager, Aaron Mueller, Samuel Marks, Arnab Sen Sharma, Francesca Lucchetti, Michael Ripa, Adam Belfki, Nikhil Prakash, Sumeet Multani, Carla Brodley, Arjun Guha, Jonathan Bell, Byron Wallace, David Bau</author></item></channel></rss>
