We achieve robot planning for general tasks by leveraging the power of video generative models trained on internet-scale data containing rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intents, and 3) translating visual planning into robot actions. We propose language-gesture conditioning to generate videos, which is both simpler and clearer than existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. We then suggest a behavioral cloning design that seamlessly incorporates the video plans. This&amp;amp;That demonstrates state-of-the-art effectiveness in addressing the above three challenges, and justifies the use of video generation as an intermediate representation for generalizable task planning and execution.

We discuss three possible sources of such contamination and show findings supporting each of them: (i) direct data leakage, (ii) indirect data leakage through the use of synthetic data and (iii) overfitting to evaluation sets during model selection.   Key to our findings is a new dataset of 161 prompts with their associated python solutions, dataset which is released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereForAI/lbpp .</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07565</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07565</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 08:53:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Alexandre Matton, Tom Sherborne, Dennis Aumiller, Elena Tommasone, Milad Alizadeh, Jingyi He, Raymond Ma, Maxime Voisin, Ellen Gilsenan-McMahon, Matthias Gall√©</author></item><item><title>CosmoCLIP: Generalizing Large Vision-Language Models for Astronomical Imaging</title><description>Existing vision-text contrastive learning models enhance representation transferability and support zero-shot prediction by matching paired image and caption embeddings while pushing unrelated pairs apart. However, astronomical image-label datasets are significantly smaller compared to general image and label datasets available from the internet. We introduce CosmoCLIP, an astronomical image-text contrastive learning framework precisely fine-tuned on the pre-trained CLIP model using SpaceNet and BLIP-based captions. SpaceNet, attained via FLARE, constitutes ~13k optimally distributed images, while BLIP acts as a rich knowledge extractor. The rich semantics derived from this SpaceNet and BLIP descriptions, when learned contrastively, enable CosmoCLIP to achieve superior generalization across various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Our results demonstrate that CosmoCLIP is a straightforward yet powerful framework, significantly outperforming CLIP in zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07315</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07315</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 08:51:52 GMT</pubDate><author>Raza Imam, Mohammed Talha Alam, Umaima Rahman, Mohsen Guizani, Fakhri Karray</author></item><item><title>An accurate detection is not all you need to combat label noise in web-noisy datasets</title><description>Training a classifier on web-crawled data demands learning algorithms that are robust to annotation errors and irrelevant examples. This paper builds upon the recent empirical observation that applying unsupervised contrastive learning to noisy, web-crawled datasets yields a feature representation under which the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are linearly separable. We show that direct estimation of the separating hyperplane can indeed offer an accurate detection of OOD samples, and yet, surprisingly, this detection does not translate into gains in classification accuracy. Digging deeper into this phenomenon, we discover that the near-perfect detection misses a type of clean examples that are valuable for supervised learning. These examples often represent visually simple images, which are relatively easy to identify as clean examples using standard loss- or distance-based methods despite being poorly separated from the OOD distribution using unsupervised learning. Because we further observe a low correlation with SOTA metrics, this urges us to propose a hybrid solution that alternates between noise detection using linear separation and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-loss approach. When combined with the SOTA algorithm PLS, we substantially improve SOTA results for real-world image classification in the presence of web noise github.com/PaulAlbert31/LSA</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05528</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05528</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 03:52:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Paul Albert, Jack Valmadre, Eric Arazo, Tarun Krishna, Noel E.

However, existing open LMMs largely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image scenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately tackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross scenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame (video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To enable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general template and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4 primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the LLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance of LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the performance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several emerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and modalities.

To overcome challenges due to limited availability of 4D training data, we advocate joint training on 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data and propose a new architecture that enables the same. We further advocate the calibration of SfM posed data using monocular metric depth estimators for metric scale camera control. For model evaluation, we introduce new metrics to enrich and overcome shortcomings of current evaluation schemes, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both fidelity and pose control compared to existing diffusion models for 3D NVS, while at the same time adding the ability to handle temporal dynamics. 4DiM is also used for improved panorama stitching, pose-conditioned video to video translation, and several other tasks.

However, the deployment of LLMs with high performance in low-resource environments has garnered significant attention in the industry. When GPU hardware resources are limited, we can explore alternative options on CPUs. To mitigate the financial burden and alleviate constraints imposed by hardware resources, optimizing inference performance is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an easily deployable inference performance optimization solution aimed at accelerating LLMs on CPUs. In this solution, we implement an effective way to reduce the KV cache size while ensuring precision. We propose a distributed inference optimization approach and implement it based on oneAPI Collective Communications Library. Furthermore, we propose optimization approaches for LLMs on CPU, and conduct tailored optimizations for the most commonly used models.

Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07667</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07667</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 01:14:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Jingwen He, Tianfan Xue, Dongyang Liu, Xinqi Lin, Peng Gao, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Wanli Ouyang, Ziwei Liu</author></item><item><title>Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment</title><description>Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework&#39;s overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:51:46 GMT</pubDate><author>Manjie Xu, Chenxing Li, Yong Ren, Rilin Chen, Yu Gu, Wei Liang, Dong Yu</author></item></channel></rss>
