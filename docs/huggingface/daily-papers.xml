State-of-the-art video Large Language Models (vLLMs) hold promise as a viable solution due to their demonstrated emergent capabilities on new tasks. However, despite being trained on millions of short seconds-long videos, vLLMs are unable to understand minutes-long videos and accurately answer questions about them. To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight and self-supervised approach, Key frame-conditioned long video-LLM (Koala), that introduces learnable spatiotemporal queries to adapt pretrained vLLMs for generalizing to longer videos. Our approach introduces two new tokenizers that condition on visual tokens computed from sparse video key frames for understanding short and long video moments. We train our proposed approach on HowTo100M and demonstrate its effectiveness on zero-shot long video understanding benchmarks, where it outperforms state-of-the-art large models by 3 - 6% in absolute accuracy across all tasks. Surprisingly, we also empirically show that our approach not only helps a pretrained vLLM to understand long videos but also improves its accuracy on short-term action recognition.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04346</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04346</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 03:59:08 GMT</pubDate><author>Reuben Tan, Ximeng Sun, Ping Hu, Jui-hsien Wang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Bryan A.

In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate &quot;any resolution&quot; on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model&#39;s reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05719</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05719</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 03:42:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Keen You, Haotian Zhang, Eldon Schoop, Floris Weers, Amanda Swearngin, Jeffrey Nichols, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan</author></item><item><title>MA-LMM: Memory-Augmented Large Multimodal Model for Long-Term Video Understanding</title><description>With the success of large language models (LLMs), integrating the vision model into LLMs to build vision-language foundation models has gained much more interest recently. However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs&#39; context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

However, substantial computational complexity poses limitations for their application in long-context tasks, such as high-resolution image generation. This paper introduces a series of architectures adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP, with requisite modifications tailored for diffusion model applied to image generation tasks, referred to as Diffusion-RWKV. Similar to the diffusion with Transformers, our model is designed to efficiently handle patchnified inputs in a sequence with extra conditions, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage manifests in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, rendering it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images, thereby eliminating the necessity for windowing or group cached operations. Experimental results on both condition and unconditional image generation tasks demonstrate that Diffison-RWKV achieves performance on par with or surpasses existing CNN or Transformer-based diffusion models in FID and IS metrics while significantly reducing total computation FLOP usage.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04478</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04478</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 03:28:10 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhengcong Fei, Mingyuan Fan, Changqian Yu, Debang Li, Junshi Huang</author></item><item><title>MagicTime: Time-lapse Video Generation Models as Metamorphic Simulators</title><description>Recent advances in Text-to-Video generation (T2V) have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing high-quality general videos from textual descriptions. A largely overlooked problem in T2V is that existing models have not adequately encoded physical knowledge of the real world, thus generated videos tend to have limited motion and poor variations. In this paper, we propose MagicTime, a metamorphic time-lapse video generation model, which learns real-world physics knowledge from time-lapse videos and implements metamorphic generation. First, we design a MagicAdapter scheme to decouple spatial and temporal training, encode more physical knowledge from metamorphic videos, and transform pre-trained T2V models to generate metamorphic videos. Second, we introduce a Dynamic Frames Extraction strategy to adapt to metamorphic time-lapse videos, which have a wider variation range and cover dramatic object metamorphic processes, thus embodying more physical knowledge than general videos. Finally, we introduce a Magic Text-Encoder to improve the understanding of metamorphic video prompts. Furthermore, we create a time-lapse video-text dataset called ChronoMagic, specifically curated to unlock the metamorphic video generation ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of MagicTime for generating high-quality and dynamic metamorphic videos, suggesting time-lapse video generation is a promising path toward building metamorphic simulators of the physical world.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05014</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05014</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 03:24:36 GMT</pubDate><author>Shenghai Yuan, Jinfa Huang, Yujun Shi, Yongqi Xu, Ruijie Zhu, Bin Lin, Xinhua Cheng, Li Yuan, Jiebo Luo</author></item><item><title>UniFL: Improve Stable Diffusion via Unified Feedback Learning</title><description>Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of image generation, leading to the proliferation of high-quality models and diverse downstream applications. However, despite these significant advancements, the current competitive solutions still suffer from several limitations, including inferior visual quality, a lack of aesthetic appeal, and inefficient inference, without a comprehensive solution in sight. To address these challenges, we present UniFL, a unified framework that leverages feedback learning to enhance diffusion models comprehensively. UniFL stands out as a universal, effective, and generalizable solution applicable to various diffusion models, such as SD1.5 and SDXL. Notably, UniFL incorporates three key components: perceptual feedback learning, which enhances visual quality; decoupled feedback learning, which improves aesthetic appeal; and adversarial feedback learning, which optimizes inference speed. In-depth experiments and extensive user studies validate the superior performance of our proposed method in enhancing both the quality of generated models and their acceleration. For instance, UniFL surpasses ImageReward by 17% user preference in terms of generation quality and outperforms LCM and SDXL Turbo by 57% and 20% in 4-step inference. Moreover, we have verified the efficacy of our approach in downstream tasks, including Lora, ControlNet, and AnimateDiff.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05595</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05595</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 03:18:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Huafeng Kuang, Pan Xie, Jiashi Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Weilin Huang, Min Zheng, Lean Fu, Guanbin Li</author></item></channel></rss>
