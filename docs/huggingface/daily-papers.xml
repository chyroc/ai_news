However, there remains a gap between its capability and the real-world applicability, primarily due to the model&#39;s limited capacity to effectively respond to various user instructions and interact with diverse visual data. In this work, we focus on bridging this gap through integrating two enhanced features: (1) comprehending images of arbitrary sizes and ratios, and (2) enabling multi-granularity image generation. We present a unified and versatile foundation model, namely, SEED-X, which is able to model multi-granularity visual semantics for comprehension and generation tasks. Besides the competitive results on public benchmarks, SEED-X demonstrates its effectiveness in handling real-world applications across various domains after instruction tuning. We hope that our work will inspire future research into what can be achieved by versatile multimodal foundation models in real-world applications. The models, codes, and datasets will be released in https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-X.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14396</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14396</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 02:15:24 GMT</pubDate><author>Yuying Ge, Sijie Zhao, Jinguo Zhu, Yixiao Ge, Kun Yi, Lin Song, Chen Li, Xiaohan Ding, Ying Shan</author></item><item><title>MultiBooth: Towards Generating All Your Concepts in an Image from Text</title><description>This paper introduces MultiBooth, a novel and efficient technique for multi-concept customization in image generation from text. Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

It has proven to be advantageous in mitigating the computational burdens associated with diffusion models. Nevertheless, the application of consistency models in music generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present Music Consistency Models (MusicCM), which leverages the concept of consistency models to efficiently synthesize mel-spectrogram for music clips, maintaining high quality while minimizing the number of sampling steps. Building upon existing text-to-music diffusion models, the MusicCM model incorporates consistency distillation and adversarial discriminator training. Moreover, we find it beneficial to generate extended coherent music by incorporating multiple diffusion processes with shared constraints. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our model in terms of computational efficiency, fidelity, and naturalness. Notable, MusicCM achieves seamless music synthesis with a mere four sampling steps, e.g., only one second per minute of the music clip, showcasing the potential for real-time application.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13358</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13358</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 01:48:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhengcong Fei, Mingyuan Fan, Junshi Huang</author></item></channel></rss>
