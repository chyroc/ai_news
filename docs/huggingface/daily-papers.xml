Despite their success, the existing methods suffer from a fundamental problem that their optimal solution is highly task-dependent (i.e., not robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks). Here we address this challenge by proposing Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization SRPO, a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework that is completely robust to the changes in the task. The key idea of SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, which can be mathematically expressed in terms of a min-max objective that aims at joint optimization of self-improvement policy and the generative policy in an adversarial fashion. The solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task and thus it is robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be re-expressed in the form of a non-adversarial offline loss which can be optimized using standard supervised optimization techniques at scale without any need for reward model and online inference. We show the effectiveness of SRPO in terms of AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. In particular, when SRPO is evaluated on the OOD XSUM dataset, it outperforms the celebrated DPO by a clear margin of 15% after 5 self-revisions, achieving WR of 90%.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01660</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01660</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 04:20:13 GMT</pubDate><author>Eugene Choi, Arash Ahmadian, Matthieu Geist, Oilvier Pietquin, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar</author></item><item><title>Seed-TTS: A Family of High-Quality Versatile Speech Generation Models</title><description>We introduce Seed-TTS, a family of large-scale autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models capable of generating speech that is virtually indistinguishable from human speech. Seed-TTS serves as a foundation model for speech generation and excels in speech in-context learning, achieving performance in speaker similarity and naturalness that matches ground truth human speech in both objective and subjective evaluations. With fine-tuning, we achieve even higher subjective scores across these metrics. Seed-TTS offers superior controllability over various speech attributes such as emotion and is capable of generating highly expressive and diverse speech for speakers in the wild. Furthermore, we propose a self-distillation method for speech factorization, as well as a reinforcement learning approach to enhance model robustness, speaker similarity, and controllability. We additionally present a non-autoregressive (NAR) variant of the Seed-TTS model, named Seed-TTS_DiT, which utilizes a fully diffusion-based architecture. Unlike previous NAR-based TTS systems, Seed-TTS_DiT does not depend on pre-estimated phoneme durations and performs speech generation through end-to-end processing. We demonstrate that this variant achieves comparable performance to the language model-based variant and showcase its effectiveness in speech editing.

We simultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where the former comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as about facts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (such as multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive an information-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. This condition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained simply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses. Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases when epistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. This is in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such as thresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in the multi-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments which demonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shed some light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can be amplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02543</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02543</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 04:18:49 GMT</pubDate><author>Yasin Abbasi Yadkori, Ilja Kuzborskij, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</author></item><item><title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title><description>The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 04:18:30 GMT</pubDate><author>Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Tuomas Kynkäänniemi, Jaakko Lehtinen, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine</author></item><item><title>RoboCasa: Large-Scale Simulation of Everyday Tasks for Generalist Robots</title><description>Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have largely been propelled by scaling. In Robotics, scaling is hindered by the lack of access to massive robot datasets. We advocate using realistic physical simulation as a means to scale environments, tasks, and datasets for robot learning methods. We present RoboCasa, a large-scale simulation framework for training generalist robots in everyday environments. RoboCasa features realistic and diverse scenes focusing on kitchen environments. We provide thousands of 3D assets across over 150 object categories and dozens of interactable furniture and appliances. We enrich the realism and diversity of our simulation with generative AI tools, such as object assets from text-to-3D models and environment textures from text-to-image models. We design a set of 100 tasks for systematic evaluation, including composite tasks generated by the guidance of large language models. To facilitate learning, we provide high-quality human demonstrations and integrate automated trajectory generation methods to substantially enlarge our datasets with minimal human burden. Our experiments show a clear scaling trend in using synthetically generated robot data for large-scale imitation learning and show great promise in harnessing simulation data in real-world tasks.

A common approach involves leveraging generative models to enhance adapters for controlled generation. However, control signals (e.g., text, audio, reference image, pose, depth map, etc.) can vary in strength. Among these, weaker conditions often struggle to be effective due to interference from stronger conditions, posing a challenge in balancing these conditions. In our work on portrait video generation, we identified audio signals as particularly weak, often overshadowed by stronger signals such as facial pose and reference image. However, direct training with weak signals often leads to difficulties in convergence. To address this, we propose V-Express, a simple method that balances different control signals through the progressive training and the conditional dropout operation. Our method gradually enables effective control by weak conditions, thereby achieving generation capabilities that simultaneously take into account the facial pose, reference image, and audio. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively generate portrait videos controlled by audio. Furthermore, a potential solution is provided for the simultaneous and effective use of conditions of varying strengths.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02511</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02511</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 04:13:51 GMT</pubDate><author>Cong Wang, Kuan Tian, Jun Zhang, Yonghang Guan, Feng Luo, Fei Shen, Zhiwei Jiang, Qing Gu, Xiao Han, Wei Yang</author></item><item><title>CamCo: Camera-Controllable 3D-Consistent Image-to-Video Generation</title><description>Recently video diffusion models have emerged as expressive generative tools for high-quality video content creation readily available to general users. However, these models often do not offer precise control over camera poses for video generation, limiting the expression of cinematic language and user control. To address this issue, we introduce CamCo, which allows fine-grained Camera pose Control for image-to-video generation. We equip a pre-trained image-to-video generator with accurately parameterized camera pose input using Pl\&quot;ucker coordinates. To enhance 3D consistency in the videos produced, we integrate an epipolar attention module in each attention block that enforces epipolar constraints to the feature maps. Additionally, we fine-tune CamCo on real-world videos with camera poses estimated through structure-from-motion algorithms to better synthesize object motion. Our experiments show that CamCo significantly improves 3D consistency and camera control capabilities compared to previous models while effectively generating plausible object motion.

This paper presents I4VGen, a training-free and plug-and-play video diffusion inference framework, which enhances text-to-video generation by leveraging robust image techniques. Specifically, following text-to-image-to-video, I4VGen decomposes the text-to-video generation into two stages: anchor image synthesis and anchor image-guided video synthesis. Correspondingly, a well-designed generation-selection pipeline is employed to achieve visually-realistic and semantically-faithful anchor image, and an innovative Noise-Invariant Video Score Distillation Sampling is incorporated to animate the image to a dynamic video, followed by a video regeneration process to refine the video. This inference strategy effectively mitigates the prevalent issue of non-zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive evaluations show that I4VGen not only produces videos with higher visual realism and textual fidelity but also integrates seamlessly into existing image-to-video diffusion models, thereby improving overall video quality.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02230</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02230</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 04:04:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Xiefan Guo, Jinlin Liu, Miaomiao Cui, Di Huang</author></item></channel></rss>
