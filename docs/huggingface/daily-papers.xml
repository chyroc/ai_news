By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods. Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators, on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better multimodal integration. Data and code are open-sourced.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01337</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01337</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 01:47:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Benno Weck, Ilaria Manco, Emmanouil Benetos, Elio Quinton, George Fazekas, Dmitry Bogdanov</author></item><item><title>Medical SAM 2: Segment medical images as video via Segment Anything Model 2</title><description>In this paper, we introduce Medical SAM 2 (MedSAM-2), an advanced segmentation model that utilizes the SAM 2 framework to address both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. By adopting the philosophy of taking medical images as videos, MedSAM-2 not only applies to 3D medical images but also unlocks new One-prompt Segmentation capability. That allows users to provide a prompt for just one or a specific image targeting an object, after which the model can autonomously segment the same type of object in all subsequent images, regardless of temporal relationships between the images. We evaluated MedSAM-2 across a variety of medical imaging modalities, including abdominal organs, optic discs, brain tumors, thyroid nodules, and skin lesions, comparing it against state-of-the-art models in both traditional and interactive segmentation settings. Our findings show that MedSAM-2 not only surpasses existing models in performance but also exhibits superior generalization across a range of medical image segmentation tasks.

Current methods for generating and assembling textures from sampled views often result in prominent seams or excessive smoothing. To tackle these issues, we present TexGen, a novel multi-view sampling and resampling framework for texture generation leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. For view consistent sampling, first of all we maintain a texture map in RGB space that is parameterized by the denoising step and updated after each sampling step of the diffusion model to progressively reduce the view discrepancy. An attention-guided multi-view sampling strategy is exploited to broadcast the appearance information across views. To preserve texture details, we develop a noise resampling technique that aids in the estimation of noise, generating inputs for subsequent denoising steps, as directed by the text prompt and current texture map. Through an extensive amount of qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our proposed method produces significantly better texture quality for diverse 3D objects with a high degree of view consistency and rich appearance details, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our proposed texture generation technique can also be applied to texture editing while preserving the original identity.

Most pre-training methodologies train a single model of a certain size at one time. Nevertheless, various computation or storage constraints in real-world scenarios require substantial efforts to develop a series of models with different sizes to deploy. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel tri-branch self-supervised training framework, termed as POA (Pre-training Once for All), to tackle this aforementioned issue. Our approach introduces an innovative elastic student branch into a modern self-distillation paradigm. At each pre-training step, we randomly sample a sub-network from the original student to form the elastic student and train all branches in a self-distilling fashion. Once pre-trained, POA allows the extraction of pre-trained models of diverse sizes for downstream tasks. Remarkably, the elastic student facilitates the simultaneous pre-training of multiple models with different sizes, which also acts as an additional ensemble of models of various sizes to enhance representation learning. Extensive experiments, including k-nearest neighbors, linear probing evaluation and assessments on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our POA. It achieves state-of-the-art performance using ViT, Swin Transformer and ResNet backbones, producing around a hundred models with different sizes through a single pre-training session.
