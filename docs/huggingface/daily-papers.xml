This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Specifically, we find that causal attention generally causes models to favor distant content, while relative positional encodings like RoPE prefer nearby ones based on the analysis of retrieval-augmented question answering (QA). Further, our empirical study on object detection reveals that position bias is also present in vision-language models (VLMs).   Based on the above analyses, we propose to ELIMINATE position bias caused by different input segment orders (e.g., options in LM-as-a-judge, retrieved documents in QA) in a TRAINING-FREE ZERO-SHOT manner. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between segments and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of segments instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the segment level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks where position bias widely exists, such as LM-as-a-judge and retrieval-augmented QA.   Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains in most cases, and makes Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview on the RewardBench reasoning subset.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01100</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01100</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 18:49:11 GMT</pubDate><author>Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham M.

Safety measures are developed and assessed on their effectiveness at defending against jailbreak attacks, indicating a belief that safety is equivalent to robustness. We assert that current defense mechanisms, such as output filters and alignment fine-tuning, are, and will remain, fundamentally insufficient for ensuring model safety. These defenses fail to address risks arising from dual-intent queries and the ability to composite innocuous outputs to achieve harmful goals. To address this critical gap, we introduce an information-theoretic threat model called inferential adversaries who exploit impermissible information leakage from model outputs to achieve malicious goals. We distinguish these from commonly studied security adversaries who only seek to force victim models to generate specific impermissible outputs. We demonstrate the feasibility of automating inferential adversaries through question decomposition and response aggregation. To provide safety guarantees, we define an information censorship criterion for censorship mechanisms, bounding the leakage of impermissible information. We propose a defense mechanism which ensures this bound and reveal an intrinsic safety-utility trade-off. Our work provides the first theoretically grounded understanding of the requirements for releasing safe LLMs and the utility costs involved.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02551</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02551</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 13:35:15 GMT</pubDate><author>David Glukhov, Ziwen Han, Ilia Shumailov, Vardan Papyan, Nicolas Papernot</author></item><item><title>TabReD: A Benchmark of Tabular Machine Learning in-the-Wild</title><description>Benchmarks that closely reflect downstream application scenarios are essential for the streamlined adoption of new research in tabular machine learning (ML). In this work, we examine existing tabular benchmarks and find two common characteristics of industry-grade tabular data that are underrepresented in the datasets available to the academic community. First, tabular data often changes over time in real-world deployment scenarios. This impacts model performance and requires time-based train and test splits for correct model evaluation. Yet, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation. Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. For each specific dataset, this can have a different impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features, which in turn can affect model selection. To fill the aforementioned gaps in academic benchmarks, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets covering a wide range of domains from finance to food delivery services. We assess a large number of tabular ML models in the feature-rich, temporally-evolving data setting facilitated by TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on time-based data splits leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits more common in academic benchmarks. Furthermore, on the TabReD datasets, MLP-like architectures and GBDT show the best results, while more sophisticated DL models are yet to prove their effectiveness.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19380</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19380</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 10:03:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Ivan Rubachev, Nikolay Kartashev, Yury Gorishniy, Artem Babenko</author></item><item><title>Investigating Decoder-only Large Language Models for Speech-to-text Translation</title><description>Large language models (LLMs), known for their exceptional reasoning capabilities, generalizability, and fluency across diverse domains, present a promising avenue for enhancing speech-related tasks. In this paper, we focus on integrating decoder-only LLMs to the task of speech-to-text translation (S2TT). We propose a decoder-only architecture that enables the LLM to directly consume the encoded speech representation and generate the text translation. Additionally, we investigate the effects of different parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and task formulation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVoST 2 and FLEURS among models trained without proprietary data. We also conduct analyses to validate the design choices of our proposed model and bring insights to the integration of LLMs to S2TT.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03169</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03169</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 06:53:59 GMT</pubDate><author>Chao-Wei Huang, Hui Lu, Hongyu Gong, Hirofumi Inaguma, Ilia Kulikov, Ruslan Mavlyutov, Sravya Popuri</author></item><item><title>DisCo-Diff: Enhancing Continuous Diffusion Models with Discrete Latents</title><description>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized generative learning. They utilize a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM&#39;s complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM&#39;s generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03300</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03300</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 05:36:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Yilun Xu, Gabriele Corso, Tommi Jaakkola, Arash Vahdat, Karsten Kreis</author></item><item><title>PicoAudio: Enabling Precise Timestamp and Frequency Controllability of Audio Events in Text-to-audio Generation</title><description>Recently, audio generation tasks have attracted considerable research interests. Precise temporal controllability is essential to integrate audio generation with real applications. In this work, we propose a temporal controlled audio generation framework, PicoAudio. PicoAudio integrates temporal information to guide audio generation through tailored model design. It leverages data crawling, segmentation, filtering, and simulation of fine-grained temporally-aligned audio-text data. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that PicoAudio dramantically surpasses current state-of-the-art generation models in terms of timestamp and occurrence frequency controllability. The generated samples are available on the demo website https://PicoAudio.github.io.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02869</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02869</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 04:28:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Zhizheng Wu, Mengyue Wu</author></item><item><title>No Training, No Problem: Rethinking Classifier-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models</title><description>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02687</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02687</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 04:08:43 GMT</pubDate><author>Seyedmorteza Sadat, Manuel Kansy, Otmar Hilliges, Romann M.

IXC-2.5 excels in various text-image comprehension and composition applications, achieving GPT-4V level capabilities with merely 7B LLM backend. Trained with 24K interleaved image-text contexts, it can seamlessly extend to 96K long contexts via RoPE extrapolation. This long-context capability allows IXC-2.5 to excel in tasks requiring extensive input and output contexts. Compared to its previous 2.0 version, InternLM-XComposer-2.5 features three major upgrades in vision-language comprehension: (1) Ultra-High Resolution Understanding, (2) Fine-Grained Video Understanding, and (3) Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialogue. In addition to comprehension, IXC-2.5 extends to two compelling applications using extra LoRA parameters for text-image composition: (1) Crafting Webpages and (2) Composing High-Quality Text-Image Articles. IXC-2.5 has been evaluated on 28 benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source state-of-the-art models on 16 benchmarks. It also surpasses or competes closely with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on 16 key tasks. The InternLM-XComposer-2.5 is publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03320</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03320</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 02:31:32 GMT</pubDate><author>Pan Zhang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Rui Qian, Lin Chen, Qipeng Guo, Haodong Duan, Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Songyang Zhang, Wenwei Zhang, Yining Li, Yang Gao, Peng Sun, Xinyue Zhang, Wei Li, Jingwen Li, Wenhai Wang, Hang Yan, Conghui He, Xingcheng Zhang, Kai Chen, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</author></item><item><title>TokenPacker: Efficient Visual Projector for Multimodal LLM</title><description>The visual projector serves as an essential bridge between the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) in a Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency.
