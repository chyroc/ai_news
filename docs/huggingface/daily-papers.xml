Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP&#39;s effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g., prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 18:53:29 GMT</pubDate><author>Alireza Ganjdanesh, Reza Shirkavand, Shangqian Gao, Heng Huang</author></item><item><title>Learn Beyond The Answer: Training Language Models with Reflection for Mathematical Reasoning</title><description>Supervised fine-tuning enhances the problem-solving abilities of language models across various mathematical reasoning tasks. To maximize such benefits, existing research focuses on broadening the training set with various data augmentation techniques, which is effective for standard single-round question-answering settings. Our work introduces a novel technique aimed at cultivating a deeper understanding of the training problems at hand, enhancing performance not only in standard settings but also in more complex scenarios that require reflective thinking. Specifically, we propose reflective augmentation, a method that embeds problem reflection into each training instance. It trains the model to consider alternative perspectives and engage with abstractions and analogies, thereby fostering a thorough comprehension through reflective reasoning. Extensive experiments validate the achievement of our aim, underscoring the unique advantages of our method and its complementary nature relative to existing augmentation techniques.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12050</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12050</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 17:00:08 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhihan Zhang, Zhenwen Liang, Wenhao Yu, Dian Yu, Mengzhao Jia, Dong Yu, Meng Jiang</author></item><item><title>SafeInfer: Context Adaptive Decoding Time Safety Alignment for Large Language Models</title><description>Safety-aligned language models often exhibit fragile and imbalanced safety mechanisms, increasing the likelihood of generating unsafe content. In addition, incorporating new knowledge through editing techniques to language models can further compromise safety. To address these issues, we propose SafeInfer, a context-adaptive, decoding-time safety alignment strategy for generating safe responses to user queries. SafeInfer comprises two phases: the safety amplification phase, which employs safe demonstration examples to adjust the model&#39;s hidden states and increase the likelihood of safer outputs, and the safety-guided decoding phase, which influences token selection based on safety-optimized distributions, ensuring the generated content complies with ethical guidelines. Further, we present HarmEval, a novel benchmark for extensive safety evaluations, designed to address potential misuse scenarios in accordance with the policies of leading AI tech giants.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12274</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12274</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 16:57:17 GMT</pubDate><author>Somnath Banerjee, Soham Tripathy, Sayan Layek, Shanu Kumar, Animesh Mukherjee, Rima Hazra</author></item><item><title>Safety Arithmetic: A Framework for Test-time Safety Alignment of Language Models by Steering Parameters and Activations</title><description>Ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical as they become integral to applications like translation and question answering. Current alignment methods struggle with dynamic user intentions and complex objectives, making models vulnerable to generating harmful content. We propose Safety Arithmetic, a training-free framework enhancing LLM safety across different scenarios: Base models, Supervised fine-tuned models (SFT), and Edited models. Safety Arithmetic involves Harm Direction Removal to avoid harmful content and Safety Alignment to promote safe responses. Additionally, we present NoIntentEdit, a dataset highlighting edit instances that could compromise model safety if used unintentionally. Our experiments show that Safety Arithmetic significantly improves safety measures, reduces over-safety, and maintains model utility, outperforming existing methods in ensuring safe content generation.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11801</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11801</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 16:52:33 GMT</pubDate><author>Rima Hazra, Sayan Layek, Somnath Banerjee, Soujanya Poria</author></item><item><title>Estimating Knowledge in Large Language Models Without Generating a Single Token</title><description>To evaluate knowledge in large language models (LLMs), current methods query the model and then evaluate its generated responses. In this work, we ask whether evaluation can be done before the model has generated any text. Concretely, is it possible to estimate how knowledgeable a model is about a certain entity, only from its internal computation? We study this question with two tasks: given a subject entity, the goal is to predict (a) the ability of the model to answer common questions about the entity, and (b) the factuality of responses generated by the model about the entity. Experiments with a variety of LLMs show that KEEN, a simple probe trained over internal subject representations, succeeds at both tasks - strongly correlating with both the QA accuracy of the model per-subject and FActScore, a recent factuality metric in open-ended generation. Moreover, KEEN naturally aligns with the model&#39;s hedging behavior and faithfully reflects changes in the model&#39;s knowledge after fine-tuning. Lastly, we show a more interpretable yet equally performant variant of KEEN, which highlights a small set of tokens that correlates with the model&#39;s lack of knowledge. Being simple and lightweight, KEEN can be leveraged to identify gaps and clusters of entity knowledge in LLMs, and guide decisions such as augmenting queries with retrieval.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12673</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12673</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 16:48:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Daniela Gottesman, Mor Geva</author></item><item><title>Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Agents</title><description>Vision-enabled language models (VLMs) are now used to build autonomous multimodal agents capable of taking actions in real environments. In this paper, we show that multimodal agents raise new safety risks, even though attacking agents is more challenging than prior attacks due to limited access to and knowledge about the environment. Our attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment: (1) our captioner attack attacks white-box captioners if they are used to process images into captions as additional inputs to the VLM; (2) our CLIP attack attacks a set of CLIP models jointly, which can transfer to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate the attacks, we curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena, an environment for web-based multimodal agent tasks. Within an L-infinity norm of 16/256 on a single image, the captioner attack can make a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute the adversarial goals with a 75% success rate. When we remove the captioner or use GPT-4V to generate its own captions, the CLIP attack can achieve success rates of 21% and 43%, respectively. Experiments on agents based on other VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5, Claude-3, and GPT-4o, show interesting differences in their robustness. Further analysis reveals several key factors contributing to the attack&#39;s success, and we also discuss the implications for defenses as well.

However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistency edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal VIdeo Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, the foundation of VIA is a novel test-time editing adaptation method, which adapts a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that adapts consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potentials for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12831</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12831</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 15:49:51 GMT</pubDate><author>Jing Gu, Yuwei Fang, Ivan Skorokhodov, Peter Wonka, Xinya Du, Sergey Tulyakov, Xin Eric Wang</author></item><item><title>From Crowdsourced Data to High-Quality Benchmarks: Arena-Hard and BenchBuilder Pipeline</title><description>The rapid evolution of language models has necessitated the development of more challenging benchmarks. Current static benchmarks often struggle to consistently distinguish between the capabilities of different models and fail to align with real-world user preferences. On the other hand, live crowd-sourced platforms like the Chatbot Arena collect a wide range of natural prompts and user feedback. However, these prompts vary in sophistication and the feedback cannot be applied offline to new models. In order to ensure that benchmarks keep up with the pace of LLM development, we address how one can evaluate benchmarks on their ability to confidently separate models and their alignment with human preference. Under these principles, we developed BenchBuilder, a living benchmark that filters high-quality prompts from live data sources to enable offline evaluation on fresh, challenging prompts. BenchBuilder identifies seven indicators of a high-quality prompt, such as the requirement for domain knowledge, and utilizes an LLM annotator to select a high-quality subset of prompts from various topic clusters. The LLM evaluation process employs an LLM judge to ensure a fully automated, high-quality, and constantly updating benchmark. We apply BenchBuilder on prompts from the Chatbot Arena to create Arena-Hard-Auto v0.1: 500 challenging user prompts from a wide range of tasks. Arena-Hard-Auto v0.1 offers 3x tighter confidence intervals than MT-Bench and achieves a state-of-the-art 89.1% agreement with human preference rankings, all at a cost of only $25 and without human labelers. The BenchBuilder pipeline enhances evaluation benchmarks and provides a valuable tool for developers, enabling them to extract high-quality benchmarks from extensive data with minimal effort.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11939</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11939</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 15:00:23 GMT</pubDate><author>Tianle Li, Wei-Lin Chiang, Evan Frick, Lisa Dunlap, Tianhao Wu, Banghua Zhu, Joseph E.

Existing depth estimation methods designed for perspective-view imagery fail when applied to 360-degree images due to different camera projections and distortions, whereas 360-degree methods perform inferior due to the lack of labeled data pairs. We propose a new depth estimation framework that utilizes unlabeled 360-degree data effectively. Our approach uses state-of-the-art perspective depth estimation models as teacher models to generate pseudo labels through a six-face cube projection technique, enabling efficient labeling of depth in 360-degree images. This method leverages the increasing availability of large datasets. Our approach includes two main stages: offline mask generation for invalid regions and an online semi-supervised joint training regime. We tested our approach on benchmark datasets such as Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D, showing significant improvements in depth estimation accuracy, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. Our proposed training pipeline can enhance any 360 monocular depth estimator and demonstrates effective knowledge transfer across different camera projections and data types.

However, existing works oversimplify software development workflows by following the waterfall model. Thus, we propose AgileCoder, a multi-agent system that integrates Agile Methodology (AM) into the framework. This system assigns specific AM roles such as Product Manager, Developer, and Tester to different agents, who then collaboratively develop software based on user inputs. AgileCoder enhances development efficiency by organizing work into sprints, focusing on incrementally developing software through sprints. Additionally, we introduce Dynamic Code Graph Generator, a module that creates a Code Dependency Graph dynamically as updates are made to the codebase. This allows agents to better comprehend the codebase, leading to more precise code generation and modifications throughout the software development process. AgileCoder surpasses existing benchmarks, like ChatDev and MetaGPT, establishing a new standard and showcasing the capabilities of multi-agent systems in advanced software engineering environments.

However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 1.6B rows from 3.1M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12031</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12031</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 08:20:38 GMT</pubDate><author>Josh Gardner, Juan C.

To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic information is further designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12459</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12459</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 07:26:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Panwang Pan, Zhuo Su, Chenguo Lin, Zhen Fan, Yongjie Zhang, Zeming Li, Tingting Shen, Yadong Mu, Yebin Liu</author></item><item><title>Mixture of Scales: Memory-Efficient Token-Adaptive Binarization for Large Language Models</title><description>Binarization, which converts weight parameters to binary values, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the size of large language models (LLMs). However, typical binarization techniques significantly diminish linguistic effectiveness of LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a novel binarization technique called Mixture of Scales (BinaryMoS). Unlike conventional methods, BinaryMoS employs multiple scaling experts for binary weights, dynamically merging these experts for each token to adaptively generate scaling factors. This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights. Moreover, because this adaptive process only involves the scaling factors rather than the entire weight matrix, BinaryMoS maintains compression efficiency similar to traditional static binarization methods. Our experimental results reveal that BinaryMoS surpasses conventional binarization techniques in various natural language processing tasks and even outperforms 2-bit quantization methods, all while maintaining similar model size to static binarization techniques.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12311</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12311</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 06:35:35 GMT</pubDate><author>Dongwon Jo, Taesu Kim, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim</author></item><item><title>Tokenization Falling Short: The Curse of Tokenization</title><description>Language models typically tokenize raw text into sequences of subword identifiers from a predefined vocabulary, a process inherently sensitive to typographical errors, length variations, and largely oblivious to the internal structure of tokens-issues we term the curse of tokenization. In this study, we delve into these drawbacks and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) remain susceptible to these problems. This study systematically investigates these challenges and their impact on LLMs through three critical research questions: (1) complex problem solving, (2) token structure probing, and (3) resilience to typographical variation. Our findings reveal that scaling model parameters can mitigate the issue of tokenization; however, LLMs still suffer from biases induced by typos and other text format variations. Our experiments show that subword regularization such as BPE-dropout can mitigate this issue. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11687</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11687</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 05:43:27 GMT</pubDate><author>Yekun Chai, Yewei Fang, Qiwei Peng, Xuhong Li</author></item><item><title>Benchmarking Multi-Image Understanding in Vision and Language Models: Perception, Knowledge, Reasoning, and Multi-Hop Reasoning</title><description>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of applications in natural language processing, with multi-modal LLMs extending these capabilities to integrate and interpret visual data. However, existing benchmarks for visual language models (VLMs) predominantly focus on single-image inputs, neglecting the crucial aspect of multi-image understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Image Relational Benchmark MIRB, designed to evaluate VLMs&#39; ability to compare, analyze, and reason across multiple images. Our benchmark encompasses four categories: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that while open-source VLMs were shown to approach the performance of GPT-4V in single-image tasks, a significant performance gap remains in multi-image reasoning tasks. Our findings also reveal that even the state-of-the-art GPT-4V model struggles with our benchmark, underscoring the need for further research and development in this area. We believe our contribution of MIRB could serve as a testbed for developing the next-generation multi-modal models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12742</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12742</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 05:17:49 GMT</pubDate><author>Bingchen Zhao, Yongshuo Zong, Letian Zhang, Timothy Hospedales</author></item><item><title>Bootstrapping Language Models with DPO Implicit Rewards</title><description>Human alignment in large language models (LLMs) is an active area of research. A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO), has greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO, after training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a novel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a bootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the rewards from a current LLM model to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate refinements that debias the length of the responses and improve the quality of the preference dataset to further improve our approach. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit rEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment and achieves superior performance than Gemini Pro on AlpacaEval 2, reaching 27.55% length-controlled win rate against GPT-4 Turbo, but with only 8B parameters and no external feedback.

While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment.   We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference data. Even when only introducing one additional data collection phase, our online BPO improves its offline DAP baseline from 72.0% to 80.2% on TL;DR and from 82.2% to 89.1% on Anthropic Helpfulness in terms of win rate against human reference text.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12168</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12168</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 03:34:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenda Xu, Jiachen Li, William Yang Wang, Lei Li</author></item><item><title>Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy: A Universal Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models</title><description>Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in addressing diverse tasks is essential for comprehending their strengths and weaknesses. Conventional evaluation techniques typically apply a single prompting strategy uniformly across datasets, not considering the varying degrees of task complexity. We introduce the Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), a taxonomy that employs a Hierarchical Prompt Framework (HPF) composed of five unique prompting strategies, arranged from the simplest to the most complex, to assess LLMs more precisely and to offer a clearer perspective. This taxonomy assigns a score, called the Hierarchical Prompting Score (HP-Score), to datasets as well as LLMs based on the rules of the taxonomy, providing a nuanced understanding of their ability to solve diverse tasks and offering a universal measure of task complexity. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Hierarchical Prompt framework, which automates the selection of appropriate prompting strategies for each task. This study compares manual and adaptive hierarchical prompt frameworks using four instruction-tuned LLMs, namely Llama 3 8B, Phi 3 3.8B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B, across four datasets: BoolQ, CommonSenseQA (CSQA), IWSLT-2017 en-fr (IWSLT), and SamSum. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HPT, providing a reliable way to compare different tasks and LLM capabilities. This paper leads to the development of a universal evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate both the complexity of the datasets and the capabilities of LLMs. The implementation of both manual HPF and adaptive HPF is publicly available.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12644</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12644</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 03:11:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Devichand Budagam, Sankalp KJ, Ashutosh Kumar, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</author></item><item><title>JEN-1 DreamStyler: Customized Musical Concept Learning via Pivotal Parameters Tuning</title><description>Large models for text-to-music generation have achieved significant progress, facilitating the creation of high-quality and varied musical compositions from provided text prompts. However, input text prompts may not precisely capture user requirements, particularly when the objective is to generate music that embodies a specific concept derived from a designated reference collection. In this paper, we propose a novel method for customized text-to-music generation, which can capture the concept from a two-minute reference music and generate a new piece of music conforming to the concept. We achieve this by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-music model using the reference music. However, directly fine-tuning all parameters leads to overfitting issues. To address this problem, we propose a Pivotal Parameters Tuning method that enables the model to assimilate the new concept while preserving its original generative capabilities. Additionally, we identify a potential concept conflict when introducing multiple concepts into the pretrained model. We present a concept enhancement strategy to distinguish multiple concepts, enabling the fine-tuned model to generate music incorporating either individual or multiple concepts simultaneously. Since we are the first to work on the customized music generation task, we also introduce a new dataset and evaluation protocol for the new task. Our proposed Jen1-DreamStyler outperforms several baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

This approach has risen in popularity due to practical applications in various applications of language models in search, question/answering, and chat-bots. However, the exact nature of how this approach works isn&#39;t clearly understood. In this paper, we mechanistically examine the RAG pipeline to highlight that language models take shortcut and have a strong bias towards utilizing only the context information to answer the question, while relying minimally on their parametric memory. We probe this mechanistic behavior in language models with: (i) Causal Mediation Analysis to show that the parametric memory is minimally utilized when answering a question and (ii) Attention Contributions and Knockouts to show that the last token residual stream do not get enriched from the subject token in the question, but gets enriched from other informative tokens in the context. We find this pronounced shortcut behaviour true across both LLaMa and Phi family of models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12824</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12824</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 02:21:31 GMT</pubDate><author>Hitesh Wadhwa, Rahul Seetharaman, Somyaa Aggarwal, Reshmi Ghosh, Samyadeep Basu, Soundararajan Srinivasan, Wenlong Zhao, Shreyas Chaudhari, Ehsan Aghazadeh</author></item><item><title>VoCo-LLaMA: Towards Vision Compression with Large Language Models</title><description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, but they are often bottlenecked by the limited context window and high computational cost of processing high-resolution image inputs and videos. Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs&#39; understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576times, resulting in up to 94.8% fewer FLOPs and 69.6% acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs&#39; contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

This report primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B. They represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of ChatGLM. To date, the GLM-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in Chinese and English, along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages, and aligned primarily for Chinese and English usage. The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval, 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval, 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser, Python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications, it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including ChatGLM-6B (three generations), GLM-4-9B (128K, 1M), GLM-4V-9B, WebGLM, and CodeGeeX, attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone.

To comprehensively evaluate current models&#39; performance in cognitive reasoning abilities, we introduce OlympicArena, which includes 11,163 bilingual problems across both text-only and interleaved text-image modalities. These challenges encompass a wide range of disciplines spanning seven fields and 62 international Olympic competitions, rigorously examined for data leakage. We argue that the challenges in Olympic competition problems are ideal for evaluating AI&#39;s cognitive reasoning due to their complexity and interdisciplinary nature, which are essential for tackling complex scientific challenges and facilitating discoveries. Beyond evaluating performance across various disciplines using answer-only criteria, we conduct detailed experiments and analyses from multiple perspectives. We delve into the models&#39; cognitive reasoning abilities, their performance across different modalities, and their outcomes in process-level evaluations, which are vital for tasks requiring complex reasoning with lengthy solutions. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97% overall accuracy, illustrating current AI limitations in complex reasoning and multimodal integration. Through the OlympicArena, we aim to advance AI towards superintelligence, equipping it to address more complex challenges in science and beyond. We also provide a comprehensive set of resources to support AI research, including a benchmark dataset, an open-source annotation platform, a detailed evaluation tool, and a leaderboard with automatic submission features.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12753</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12753</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 01:43:21 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhen Huang, Zengzhi Wang, Shijie Xia, Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou, Ruijie Xu, Run-Ze Fan, Lyumanshan Ye, Ethan Chern, Yixin Ye, Yikai Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Ting Wu, Binjie Wang, Shichao Sun, Yang Xiao, Yiyuan Li, Fan Zhou, Steffi Chern, Yiwei Qin, Yan Ma, Jiadi Su, Yixiu Liu, Yuxiang Zheng, Shaoting Zhang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Pengfei Liu</author></item><item><title>DeepSeek-Coder-V2: Breaking the Barrier of Closed-Source Models in Code Intelligence</title><description>We present DeepSeek-Coder-V2, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code language model that achieves performance comparable to GPT4-Turbo in code-specific tasks.

Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12246</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12246</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 01:21:45 GMT</pubDate><author>Byung-Kwan Lee, Sangyun Chung, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro</author></item><item><title>Language Models are Surprisingly Fragile to Drug Names in Biomedical Benchmarks</title><description>Medical knowledge is context-dependent and requires consistent reasoning across various natural language expressions of semantically equivalent phrases. This is particularly crucial for drug names, where patients often use brand names like Advil or Tylenol instead of their generic equivalents. To study this, we create a new robustness dataset, RABBITS, to evaluate performance differences on medical benchmarks after swapping brand and generic drug names using physician expert annotations.   We assess both open-source and API-based LLMs on MedQA and MedMCQA, revealing a consistent performance drop ranging from 1-10\%. Furthermore, we identify a potential source of this fragility as the contamination of test data in widely used pre-training datasets. All code is accessible at https://github.com/BittermanLab/RABBITS, and a HuggingFace leaderboard is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIM-Harvard/rabbits-leaderboard.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12066</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12066</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 00:46:58 GMT</pubDate><author>Jack Gallifant, Shan Chen, Pedro Moreira, Nikolaj Munch, Mingye Gao, Jackson Pond, Leo Anthony Celi, Hugo Aerts, Thomas Hartvigsen, Danielle Bitterman</author></item><item><title>RepLiQA: A Question-Answering Dataset for Benchmarking LLMs on Unseen Reference Content</title><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data, most of which is automatically scraped from the internet. This data includes encyclopedic documents that harbor a vast amount of general knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) but also potentially overlap with benchmark datasets used for evaluating LLMs. Consequently, evaluating models on test splits that might have leaked into the training set is prone to misleading conclusions. To foster sound evaluation of language models, we introduce a new test dataset named RepLiQA, suited for question-answering and topic retrieval tasks. RepLiQA is a collection of five splits of test sets, four of which have not been released to the internet or exposed to LLM APIs prior to this publication. Each sample in RepLiQA comprises (1) a reference document crafted by a human annotator and depicting an imaginary scenario (e.g., a news article) absent from the internet; (2) a question about the document&#39;s topic; (3) a ground-truth answer derived directly from the information in the document; and (4) the paragraph extracted from the reference document containing the answer. As such, accurate answers can only be generated if a model can find relevant content within the provided document. We run a large-scale benchmark comprising several state-of-the-art LLMs to uncover differences in performance across models of various types and sizes in a context-conditional language modeling setting. Released splits of RepLiQA can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow/repliqa.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11811</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11811</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 00:29:44 GMT</pubDate><author>Joao Monteiro, Pierre-Andre Noel, Etienne Marcotte, Sai Rajeswar, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vazquez, Nicolas Chapados, Christopher Pal, Perouz Taslakian</author></item></channel></rss>
