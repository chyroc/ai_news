On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird&#39;s eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

Inspired by human cognitive processes, this paper investigates the optimal planning power of language models that can construct a cognitive map of a given environment. Our experiments demonstrate that cognitive map significantly enhances the performance of both optimal and reachable planning generation ability in the Gridworld path planning task. We observe that our method showcases two key characteristics similar to human cognition: generalization of its planning ability to extrapolated environments and rapid adaptation with limited training data. We hope our findings in the Gridworld task provide insights into modeling human cognitive processes in language models, potentially leading to the development of more advanced and robust systems that better resemble human cognition.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15275</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15275</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 05:07:58 GMT</pubDate><author>Doyoung Kim, Jongwon Lee, Jinho Park, Minjoon Seo</author></item><item><title>Two Giraffes in a Dirt Field: Using Game Play to Investigate Situation Modelling in Large Multimodal Models</title><description>While the situation has improved for text-only models, it again seems to be the case currently that multimodal (text and image) models develop faster than ways to evaluate them. In this paper, we bring a recently developed evaluation paradigm from text models to multimodal models, namely evaluation through the goal-oriented game (self) play, complementing reference-based and preference-based evaluation. Specifically, we define games that challenge a model&#39;s capability to represent a situation from visual information and align such representations through dialogue. We find that the largest closed models perform rather well on the games that we define, while even the best open-weight models struggle with them. On further analysis, we find that the exceptional deep captioning capabilities of the largest models drive some of the performance. There is still room to grow for both kinds of models, ensuring the continued relevance of the benchmark.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14035</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14035</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 04:34:23 GMT</pubDate><author>Sherzod Hakimov, Yerkezhan Abdullayeva, Kushal Koshti, Antonia Schmidt, Yan Weiser, Anne Beyer, David Schlangen</author></item><item><title>Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges</title><description>Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges. We leverage TriviaQA as a benchmark for assessing objective knowledge reasoning of LLMs and evaluate them alongside human annotations which we found to have a high inter-annotator agreement. Our study includes 9 judge models and 9 exam taker models -- both base and instruction-tuned. We assess the judge model&#39;s alignment across different model sizes, families, and judge prompts. Among other results, our research rediscovers the importance of using Cohen&#39;s kappa as a metric of alignment as opposed to simple percent agreement, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores. We find that both Llama-3 70B and GPT-4 Turbo have an excellent alignment with humans, but in terms of ranking exam taker models, they are outperformed by both JudgeLM-7B and the lexical judge Contains, which have up to 34 points lower human alignment. Through error analysis and various other studies, including the effects of instruction length and leniency bias, we hope to provide valuable lessons for using LLMs as judges in the future.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 04:30:36 GMT</pubDate><author>Aman Singh Thakur, Kartik Choudhary, Venkat Srinik Ramayapally, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, Dieuwke Hupkes</author></item><item><title>Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell</title><description>Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder&#39;s latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule&#39;s neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction against up to 19 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12056</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12056</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 04:22:20 GMT</pubDate><author>Gang Liu, Srijit Seal, John Arevalo, Zhenwen Liang, Anne E.

However, their performance on particular tasks such as document understanding is still limited. They also require more compute, time, and engineering resources to finetune and deploy compared to traditional, unimodal models. In this report, we present Multimodal Structured Generation, a general framework which constrains the output logits of frozen MMFMs to force them to reason before responding with structured outputs that downstream APIs can parse and use. We provide a detailed account of our approach, including the technical details, theoretical discussions, and final evaluation results in the 2nd Multimodal Foundation Models Challenge hosted by the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference. Our approach achieved the second highest score in the hidden test set for Phase 2 and third highest overall. This shows the method&#39;s ability to generalize to unseen tasks. And that simple engineering can beat expensive &amp;amp; complicated modelling steps as we first discussed in our paper, Retrieval Augmented Structured Generation: Business Document Information Extraction as Tool Use.

Many preference optimization approaches have been proposed that fine-tune LLM parameters to achieve good alignment. However, such parameter tuning is known to interfere with model performance on many tasks. Moreover, keeping up with shifting user preferences is tricky in such a situation. Decoding-time alignment with reward model guidance solves these issues at the cost of increased inference time. However, most of such methods fail to strike the right balance between exploration and exploitation of reward -- often due to the conflated formulation of these two aspects - to give well-aligned responses. To remedy this we decouple these two aspects and implement them in an evolutionary fashion: exploration is enforced by decoding from mutated instructions and exploitation is represented as the periodic replacement of poorly-rewarded generations with well-rewarded ones. Empirical evidences indicate that this strategy outperforms many preference optimization and decode-time alignment approaches on two widely accepted alignment benchmarks AlpacaEval 2 and MT-Bench. Our implementation will be available at: https://darwin-alignment.github.io.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15193</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15193</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 03:13:42 GMT</pubDate><author>Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Ambuj Mehrish, Soujanya Poria</author></item><item><title>Stylebreeder: Exploring and Democratizing Artistic Styles through Text-to-Image Models</title><description>Text-to-image models are becoming increasingly popular, revolutionizing the landscape of digital art creation by enabling highly detailed and creative visual content generation. These models have been widely employed across various domains, particularly in art generation, where they facilitate a broad spectrum of creative expression and democratize access to artistic creation. In this paper, we introduce STYLEBREEDER, a comprehensive dataset of 6.8M images and 1.8M prompts generated by 95K users on Artbreeder, a platform that has emerged as a significant hub for creative exploration with over 13M users. We introduce a series of tasks with this dataset aimed at identifying diverse artistic styles, generating personalized content, and recommending styles based on user interests. By documenting unique, user-generated styles that transcend conventional categories like &#39;cyberpunk&#39; or &#39;Picasso,&#39; we explore the potential for unique, crowd-sourced styles that could provide deep insights into the collective creative psyche of users worldwide. We also evaluate different personalization methods to enhance artistic expression and introduce a style atlas, making these models available in LoRA format for public use. Our research demonstrates the potential of text-to-image diffusion models to uncover and promote unique artistic expressions, further democratizing AI in art and fostering a more diverse and inclusive artistic community.

However, the development of automatic video metrics is lagging significantly behind. None of the existing metric is able to provide reliable scores over generated videos. The main barrier is the lack of large-scale human-annotated dataset. In this paper, we release VideoFeedback, the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multi-aspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models. We train MantisScore (initialized from Mantis) based on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman correlation between MantisScore and humans can reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that MantisScore has consistently much higher correlation with human judges than other metrics. Due to these results, we believe MantisScore can serve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to track progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15252</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15252</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 02:00:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Xuan He, Dongfu Jiang, Ge Zhang, Max Ku, Achint Soni, Sherman Siu, Haonan Chen, Abhranil Chandra, Ziyan Jiang, Aaran Arulraj, Kai Wang, Quy Duc Do, Yuansheng Ni, Bohan Lyu, Yaswanth Narsupalli, Rongqi Fan, Zhiheng Lyu, Yuchen Lin, Wenhu Chen</author></item><item><title>LongRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-context LLMs</title><description>In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle&#39; unit. In contrast, the readers only need to extract answers from the short retrieved units. Such an imbalanced `heavy&#39; retriever and `light&#39; reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever&#39; and a `long reader&#39;. LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia into 4K-token units, which is 30x longer than before. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total units from 22M to 700K. This significantly lowers the burden of retriever, which leads to a remarkable retrieval score: answer recall@1=71% on NQ (previously 52%) and answer recall@2=72% (previously 47%) on HotpotQA (full-wiki). Then we feed the top-k retrieved units (approx 30K tokens) to an existing long-context LLM to perform zero-shot answer extraction. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ, which is the best known result. LongRAG also achieves 64.3% on HotpotQA (full-wiki), which is on par of the SoTA model. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15319</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15319</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 01:58:20 GMT</pubDate><author>Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</author></item><item><title>Jailbreaking as a Reward Misspecification Problem</title><description>The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their safety and reliability, particularly regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that attributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment process. We introduce a metric ReGap to quantify the extent of reward misspecification and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting harmful backdoor prompts. Building upon these insights, we present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts against various target aligned LLMs. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark while preserving the human readability of the generated prompts. Detailed analysis highlights the unique advantages brought by the proposed reward misspecification objective compared to previous methods.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14393</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14393</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 01:15:05 GMT</pubDate><author>Zhihui Xie, Jiahui Gao, Lei Li, Zhenguo Li, Qi Liu, Lingpeng Kong</author></item><item><title>ToVo: Toxicity Taxonomy via Voting</title><description>Existing toxic detection models face significant limitations, such as lack of transparency, customization, and reproducibility. These challenges stem from the closed-source nature of their training data and the paucity of explanations for their evaluation mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a dataset creation mechanism that integrates voting and chain-of-thought processes, producing a high-quality open-source dataset for toxic content detection. Our methodology ensures diverse classification metrics for each sample and includes both classification scores and explanatory reasoning for the classifications.   We utilize the dataset created through our proposed mechanism to train our model, which is then compared against existing widely-used detectors. Our approach not only enhances transparency and customizability but also facilitates better fine-tuning for specific use cases. This work contributes a robust framework for developing toxic content detection models, emphasizing openness and adaptability, thus paving the way for more effective and user-specific content moderation solutions.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14835</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14835</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 01:05:02 GMT</pubDate><author>Tinh Son Luong, Thanh-Thien Le, Thang Viet Doan, Linh Ngo Van, Thien Huu Nguyen, Diep Thi-Ngoc Nguyen</author></item><item><title>How Well Do LLMs Represent Values Across Cultures? Empirical Analysis of LLM Responses Based on Hofstede Cultural Dimensions</title><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to imitate human behavior by responding to humans in a way that pleases them, including by adhering to their values. However, humans come from diverse cultures with different values. It is critical to understand whether LLMs showcase different values to the user based on the stereotypical values of a user&#39;s known country. We prompt different LLMs with a series of advice requests based on 5 Hofstede Cultural Dimensions -- a quantifiable way of representing the values of a country. Throughout each prompt, we incorporate personas representing 36 different countries and, separately, languages predominantly tied to each country to analyze the consistency in the LLMs&#39; cultural understanding. Through our analysis of the responses, we found that LLMs can differentiate between one side of a value and another, as well as understand that countries have differing values, but will not always uphold the values when giving advice, and fail to understand the need to answer differently based on different cultural values. Rooted in these findings, we present recommendations for training value-aligned and culturally sensitive LLMs. More importantly, the methodology and the framework developed here can help further understand and mitigate culture and language alignment issues with LLMs.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14805</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14805</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:23:15 GMT</pubDate><author>Julia Kharchenko, Tanya Roosta, Aman Chadha, Chirag Shah</author></item></channel></rss>
