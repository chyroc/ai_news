To address this, we dedicate 35,000 A100-SXM4-80GB GPU hours in conducting extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs~(by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model~(M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model. The code~\url{https://github.com/CONE-MT/LLaMAX/.} and models~\url{https://huggingface.co/LLaMAX/.} are publicly available.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05975</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05975</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 01:59:21 GMT</pubDate><author>Yinquan Lu, Wenhao Zhu, Lei Li, Yu Qiao, Fei Yuan</author></item></channel></rss>
