However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16287</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16287</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 04:40:21 GMT</pubDate><author>Xinyu Zhou, Boris Knyazev, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Jie Fu</author></item><item><title>Looking Backward: Streaming Video-to-Video Translation with Feature Banks</title><description>This paper introduces StreamV2V, a diffusion model that achieves real-time streaming video-to-video (V2V) translation with user prompts. Unlike prior V2V methods using batches to process limited frames, we opt to process frames in a streaming fashion, to support unlimited frames. At the heart of StreamV2V lies a backward-looking principle that relates the present to the past. This is realized by maintaining a feature bank, which archives information from past frames. For incoming frames, StreamV2V extends self-attention to include banked keys and values and directly fuses similar past features into the output. The feature bank is continually updated by merging stored and new features, making it compact but informative. StreamV2V stands out for its adaptability and efficiency, seamlessly integrating with image diffusion models without fine-tuning. It can run 20 FPS on one A100 GPU, being 15x, 46x, 108x, and 158x faster than FlowVid, CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively. Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm StreamV2V&#39;s exceptional ability to maintain temporal consistency.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15757</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15757</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 04:34:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Feng Liang, Akio Kodaira, Chenfeng Xu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Diana Marculescu</author></item><item><title>I2VEdit: First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Image-to-Video Diffusion Models</title><description>The remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models have motivated extensive research in both image and video editing. Compared to video editing which faces additional challenges in the time dimension, image editing has witnessed the development of more diverse, high-quality approaches and more capable software like Photoshop. In light of this gap, we introduce a novel and generic solution that extends the applicability of image editing tools to videos by propagating edits from a single frame to the entire video using a pre-trained image-to-video model. Our method, dubbed I2VEdit, adaptively preserves the visual and motion integrity of the source video depending on the extent of the edits, effectively handling global edits, local edits, and moderate shape changes, which existing methods cannot fully achieve. At the core of our method are two main processes: Coarse Motion Extraction to align basic motion patterns with the original video, and Appearance Refinement for precise adjustments using fine-grained attention matching. We also incorporate a skip-interval strategy to mitigate quality degradation from auto-regressive generation across multiple video clips. Experimental results demonstrate our framework&#39;s superior performance in fine-grained video editing, proving its capability to produce high-quality, temporally consistent outputs.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16537</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16537</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 04:29:20 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenqi Ouyang, Yi Dong, Lei Yang, Jianlou Si, Xingang Pan</author></item><item><title>Transformers Can Do Arithmetic with the Right Embeddings</title><description>The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further.   With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17399</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17399</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 04:18:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Sean McLeish, Arpit Bansal, Alex Stein, Neel Jain, John Kirchenbauer, Brian R.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16712</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16712</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:37:29 GMT</pubDate><author>Paolo Glorioso, Quentin Anthony, Yury Tokpanov, James Whittington, Jonathan Pilault, Adam Ibrahim, Beren Millidge</author></item><item><title>Vidu4D: Single Generated Video to High-Fidelity 4D Reconstruction with Dynamic Gaussian Surfels</title><description>Video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to generate realistic and imaginative frames. Besides, these models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, significantly enhancing their potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Vidu4D, a novel reconstruction model that excels in accurately reconstructing 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) representations from single generated videos, addressing challenges associated with non-rigidity and frame distortion. This capability is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. At the core of Vidu4D is our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS) technique. DGS optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. This transformation enables a precise depiction of motion and deformation over time. To preserve the structural integrity of surface-aligned Gaussian surfels, we design the warped-state geometric regularization based on continuous warping fields for estimating normals. Additionally, we learn refinements on rotation and scaling parameters of Gaussian surfels, which greatly alleviates texture flickering during the warping process and enhances the capture of fine-grained appearance details. Vidu4D also contains a novel initialization state that provides a proper start for the warping fields in DGS. Equipping Vidu4D with an existing video generative model, the overall framework demonstrates high-fidelity text-to-4D generation in both appearance and geometry.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16822</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16822</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:32:15 GMT</pubDate><author>Yikai Wang, Xinzhou Wang, Zilong Chen, Zhengyi Wang, Fuchun Sun, Jun Zhu</author></item><item><title>NV-Embed: Improved Techniques for Training LLMs as Generalist Embedding Models</title><description>Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model with a variety of architectural designs and training procedures to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last &lt;eos&gt; token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For model training, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval datasets into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. Combining these techniques, our NV-Embed model, using only publicly available data, has achieved a record-high score of 69.32, ranking No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), with 56 tasks, encompassing retrieval, reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks. Notably, our model also attains the highest score of 59.36 on 15 retrieval tasks in the MTEB benchmark (also known as BEIR). We will open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v1.&lt;/eos&gt;</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17428</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17428</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:27:34 GMT</pubDate><author>Chankyu Lee, Rajarshi Roy, Mengyao Xu, Jonathan Raiman, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</author></item><item><title>EM Distillation for One-step Diffusion Models</title><description>While diffusion models can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process. Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16852</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16852</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:24:07 GMT</pubDate><author>Sirui Xie, Zhisheng Xiao, Diederik P Kingma, Tingbo Hou, Ying Nian Wu, Kevin Patrick Murphy, Tim Salimans, Ben Poole, Ruiqi Gao</author></item><item><title>Part123: Part-aware 3D Reconstruction from a Single-view Image</title><description>Recently, the emergence of diffusion models has opened up new opportunities for single-view reconstruction. However, all the existing methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, thus neglecting the part-based structure, which is crucial for many downstream applications, of the reconstructed shape. Moreover, the generated meshes usually suffer from large noises, unsmooth surfaces, and blurry textures, making it challenging to obtain satisfactory part segments using 3D segmentation techniques. In this paper, we present Part123, a novel framework for part-aware 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. We first use diffusion models to generate multiview-consistent images from a given image, and then leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM), which demonstrates powerful generalization ability on arbitrary objects, to generate multiview segmentation masks. To effectively incorporate 2D part-based information into 3D reconstruction and handle inconsistency, we introduce contrastive learning into a neural rendering framework to learn a part-aware feature space based on the multiview segmentation masks. A clustering-based algorithm is also developed to automatically derive 3D part segmentation results from the reconstructed models. Experiments show that our method can generate 3D models with high-quality segmented parts on various objects. Compared to existing unstructured reconstruction methods, the part-aware 3D models from our method benefit some important applications, including feature-preserving reconstruction, primitive fitting, and 3D shape editing.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16888</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16888</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:21:52 GMT</pubDate><author>Anran Liu, Cheng Lin, Yuan Liu, Xiaoxiao Long, Zhiyang Dou, Hao-Xiang Guo, Ping Luo, Wenping Wang</author></item><item><title>Greedy Growing Enables High-Resolution Pixel-Based Diffusion Models</title><description>We address the long-standing problem of how to learn effective pixel-based image diffusion models at scale, introducing a remarkably simple greedy growing method for stable training of large-scale, high-resolution models. without the needs for cascaded super-resolution components. The key insight stems from careful pre-training of core components, namely, those responsible for text-to-image alignment {\it vs.} high-resolution rendering. We first demonstrate the benefits of scaling a {\it Shallow UNet}, with no down(up)-sampling enc(dec)oder. Scaling its deep core layers is shown to improve alignment, object structure, and composition. Building on this core model, we propose a greedy algorithm that grows the architecture into high-resolution end-to-end models, while preserving the integrity of the pre-trained representation, stabilizing training, and reducing the need for large high-resolution datasets. This enables a single stage model capable of generating high-resolution images without the need of a super-resolution cascade. Our key results rely on public datasets and show that we are able to train non-cascaded models up to 8B parameters with no further regularization schemes. Vermeer, our full pipeline model trained with internal datasets to produce 1024x1024 images, without cascades, is preferred by 44.0% vs. 21.4% human evaluators over SDXL.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16759</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16759</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:16:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Cristina N.

From having a visual assistant that could guide us through unfamiliar environments to generative models that produce images using only a high-level text description, the vision-language model (VLM) applications will significantly impact our relationship with technology. However, there are many challenges that need to be addressed to improve the reliability of those models. While language is discrete, vision evolves in a much higher dimensional space in which concepts cannot always be easily discretized. To better understand the mechanics behind mapping vision to language, we present this introduction to VLMs which we hope will help anyone who would like to enter the field. First, we introduce what VLMs are, how they work, and how to train them. Then, we present and discuss approaches to evaluate VLMs. Although this work primarily focuses on mapping images to language, we also discuss extending VLMs to videos.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17247</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17247</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:14:41 GMT</pubDate><author>Florian Bordes, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Anurag Ajay, Alexander C.

These additional LoRA parameters are specific to the base model being adapted. When the base model needs to be deprecated and replaced with a new one, all the associated LoRA modules need to be re-trained. Such re-training requires access to the data used to train the LoRA for the original base model. This is especially problematic for commercial cloud applications where the LoRA modules and the base models are hosted by service providers who may not be allowed to host proprietary client task data. To address this challenge, we propose Trans-LoRA -- a novel method for lossless, nearly data-free transfer of LoRAs across base models. Our approach relies on synthetic data to transfer LoRA modules. Using large language models, we design a synthetic data generator to approximate the data-generating process of the observed task data subset. Training on the resulting synthetic dataset transfers LoRA modules to new models. We show the effectiveness of our approach using both LLama and Gemma model families. Our approach achieves lossless (mostly improved) LoRA transfer between models within and across different base model families, and even between different PEFT methods, on a wide variety of tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17258</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17258</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 03:12:03 GMT</pubDate><author>Runqian Wang, Soumya Ghosh, David Cox, Diego Antognini, Aude Oliva, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky</author></item><item><title>Human4DiT: Free-view Human Video Generation with 4D Diffusion Transformer</title><description>We present a novel approach for generating high-quality, spatio-temporally coherent human videos from a single image under arbitrary viewpoints. Our framework combines the strengths of U-Nets for accurate condition injection and diffusion transformers for capturing global correlations across viewpoints and time. The core is a cascaded 4D transformer architecture that factorizes attention across views, time, and spatial dimensions, enabling efficient modeling of the 4D space. Precise conditioning is achieved by injecting human identity, camera parameters, and temporal signals into the respective transformers. To train this model, we curate a multi-dimensional dataset spanning images, videos, multi-view data and 3D/4D scans, along with a multi-dimensional training strategy. Our approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods based on GAN or UNet-based diffusion models, which struggle with complex motions and viewpoint changes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method&#39;s ability to synthesize realistic, coherent and free-view human videos, paving the way for advanced multimedia applications in areas such as virtual reality and animation.

Adding control to the video generation process is an important goal moving forward and recent approaches that condition video generation models on camera trajectories make strides towards it. Yet, it remains challenging to generate a video of the same scene from multiple different camera trajectories. Solutions to this multi-video generation problem could enable large-scale 3D scene generation with editable camera trajectories, among other applications. We introduce collaborative video diffusion (CVD) as an important step towards this vision. The CVD framework includes a novel cross-video synchronization module that promotes consistency between corresponding frames of the same video rendered from different camera poses using an epipolar attention mechanism. Trained on top of a state-of-the-art camera-control module for video generation, CVD generates multiple videos rendered from different camera trajectories with significantly better consistency than baselines, as shown in extensive experiments.

These models first embed images into a fixed large number of visual tokens and then feed them into a Large Language Model (LLM). However, this design causes an excessive number of tokens for dense visual scenarios such as high-resolution images and videos, leading to great inefficiency. While token pruning/merging methods do exist, they produce a single length output for each image and do not afford flexibility in trading off information density v.s. efficiency. Inspired by the concept of Matryoshka Dolls, we propose M3: Matryoshka Multimodal Models, which learns to represent visual content as nested sets of visual tokens that capture information across multiple coarse-to-fine granularities. Our approach offers several unique benefits for LMMs: (1) One can explicitly control the visual granularity per test instance during inference, e.g. , adjusting the number of tokens used to represent an image based on the anticipated complexity or simplicity of the content; (2) M3 provides a framework for analyzing the granularity needed for existing datasets, where we find that COCO-style benchmarks only need around ~9 visual tokens to obtain accuracy similar to that of using all 576 tokens; (3) Our approach provides a foundation to explore the best trade-off between performance and visual token length at sample level, where our investigation reveals that a large gap exists between the oracle upper bound and current fixed-scale representations.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17430</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17430</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 02:55:36 GMT</pubDate><author>Mu Cai, Jianwei Yang, Jianfeng Gao, Yong Jae Lee</author></item></channel></rss>
