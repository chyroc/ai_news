However, most existing MLLMs are not well suited for document-oriented tasks, which require fine-grained image perception and information compression. In this paper, we present TextHawk, a MLLM that is specifically designed for document-oriented tasks, while preserving the general capabilities of MLLMs. TextHawk is aimed to explore efficient fine-grained perception by designing four dedicated components. Firstly, a ReSampling and ReArrangement (ReSA) module is proposed to reduce the redundancy in the document texts and lower the computational cost of the MLLM. We explore encoding the positions of each local feature by presenting Scalable Positional Embeddings (SPEs), which can preserve the scalability of various image sizes. A Query Proposal Network (QPN) is then adopted to initialize the queries dynamically among different sub-images. To further enhance the fine-grained visual perceptual ability of the MLLM, we design a Multi-Level Cross-Attention (MLCA) mechanism that captures the hierarchical structure and semantic relations of document images. Furthermore, we create a new instruction-tuning dataset for document-oriented tasks by enriching the multimodal document data with Gemini Pro. We conduct extensive experiments on both general and document-oriented MLLM benchmarks, and show that TextHawk outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained document perception and general abilities.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09204</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09204</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 05:58:31 GMT</pubDate><author>Ya-Qi Yu, Minghui Liao, Jihao Wu, Yongxin Liao, Xiaoyu Zheng, Wei Zeng</author></item><item><title>On Speculative Decoding for Multimodal Large Language Models</title><description>Inference with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is slow due to their large-language-model backbone which suffers from memory bandwidth bottleneck and generates tokens auto-regressively. In this paper, we explore the application of speculative decoding to enhance the inference efficiency of MLLMs, specifically the LLaVA 7B model. We show that a language-only model can serve as a good draft model for speculative decoding with LLaVA 7B, bypassing the need for image tokens and their associated processing components from the draft model. Our experiments across three different tasks show that speculative decoding can achieve a memory-bound speedup of up to 2.37times using a 115M parameter language model that we trained from scratch. Additionally, we introduce a compact LLaVA draft model incorporating an image adapter, which shows marginal performance gains in image captioning while maintaining comparable results in other tasks.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08856</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08856</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 04:12:49 GMT</pubDate><author>Mukul Gagrani, Raghavv Goel, Wonseok Jeon, Junyoung Park, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott</author></item><item><title>CompGS: Efficient 3D Scene Representation via Compressed Gaussian Splatting</title><description>Gaussian splatting, renowned for its exceptional rendering quality and efficiency, has emerged as a prominent technique in 3D scene representation. However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality. Our code will be released on GitHub for further research.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09458</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09458</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 04:07:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Xiangrui Liu, Xinju Wu, Pingping Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Zhu Li, Sam Kwong</author></item><item><title>Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly</title><description>There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of &quot;intelligence&quot;, we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 30 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs&#39; intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09937</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09937</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 04:02:54 GMT</pubDate><author>Yuzhen Huang, Jinghan Zhang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He</author></item><item><title>Megalodon: Efficient LLM Pretraining and Inference with Unlimited Context Length</title><description>The quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation of Transformers limits their ability to scale to long sequences, and while sub-quadratic solutions like linear attention and state space models exist, they empirically underperform Transformers in pretraining efficiency and downstream task accuracy. We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).

In this paper, we present Video2Game, a novel approach that automatically converts videos of real-world scenes into realistic and interactive game environments. At the heart of our system are three core components:(i) a neural radiance fields (NeRF) module that effectively captures the geometry and visual appearance of the scene; (ii) a mesh module that distills the knowledge from NeRF for faster rendering; and (iii) a physics module that models the interactions and physical dynamics among the objects. By following the carefully designed pipeline, one can construct an interactable and actionable digital replica of the real world. We benchmark our system on both indoor and large-scale outdoor scenes. We show that we can not only produce highly-realistic renderings in real-time, but also build interactive games on top.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 03:53:12 GMT</pubDate><author>Hongchi Xia, Zhi-Hao Lin, Wei-Chiu Ma, Shenlong Wang</author></item><item><title>TransformerFAM: Feedback attention is working memory</title><description>While Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, their quadratic attention complexity hinders their ability to process infinitely long inputs. We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 03:49:58 GMT</pubDate><author>Dongseong Hwang, Weiran Wang, Zhuoyuan Huo, Khe Chai Sim, Pedro Moreno Mengibar</author></item><item><title>Taming Latent Diffusion Model for Neural Radiance Field Inpainting</title><description>Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a representation for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Despite some recent work showing preliminary success in editing a reconstructed NeRF with diffusion prior, they remain struggling to synthesize reasonable geometry in completely uncovered regions. One major reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model, which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors. These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model&#39;s stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift with masked adversarial training. During the analyses, we also found the commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting task. Through rigorous experiments, our framework yields state-of-the-art NeRF inpainting results on various real-world scenes.

Unlike prior approaches relying on attribute guidance or human feedback on building datasets, we devise a scalable data collection pipeline leveraging advanced foundation models, namely GPT-4V and DALL-E 3. To ensure its high quality, diverse examples are first collected online, expanded, and then used to create high-quality diptychs featuring input and output images with detailed text prompts, followed by precise alignment ensured through post-processing. In addition, we propose two evaluation metrics, Alignment and Coherence, to quantitatively assess the quality of image edit pairs using GPT-4V. HQ-Edits high-resolution images, rich in detail and accompanied by comprehensive editing prompts, substantially enhance the capabilities of existing image editing models. For example, an HQ-Edit finetuned InstructPix2Pix can attain state-of-the-art image editing performance, even surpassing those models fine-tuned with human-annotated data.

Researchers continuously invent various tricks to address this shortcoming. For instance, in the fundamental Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) technique of Language Model alignment, in addition to reward maximization, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the trainable policy and the SFT policy is minimized. This addition prevents the model from being overfitted to the Reward Model (RM) and generating texts that are out-of-domain for the RM. The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method reformulates the optimization task of RLHF and eliminates the Reward Model while tacitly maintaining the requirement for the policy to be close to the SFT policy. In our paper, we argue that this implicit limitation in the DPO method leads to sub-optimal results. We propose a new method called Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO), which updates the reference policy during training. With such a straightforward update, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TR-DPO against DPO on the Anthropic HH and TLDR datasets. We show that TR-DPO outperforms DPO by up to 19%, measured by automatic evaluation with GPT-4. The new alignment approach that we propose allows us to improve the quality of models across several parameters at once, such as coherence, correctness, level of detail, helpfulness, and harmlessness.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09656</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09656</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 03:00:09 GMT</pubDate><author>Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov</author></item><item><title>Ctrl-Adapter: An Efficient and Versatile Framework for Adapting Diverse Controls to Any Diffusion Model</title><description>ControlNets are widely used for adding spatial control in image generation with different conditions, such as depth maps, canny edges, and human poses. However, there are several challenges when leveraging the pretrained image ControlNets for controlled video generation. First, pretrained ControlNet cannot be directly plugged into new backbone models due to the mismatch of feature spaces, and the cost of training ControlNets for new backbones is a big burden. Second, ControlNet features for different frames might not effectively handle the temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce Ctrl-Adapter, an efficient and versatile framework that adds diverse controls to any image/video diffusion models, by adapting pretrained ControlNets (and improving temporal alignment for videos). Ctrl-Adapter provides diverse capabilities including image control, video control, video control with sparse frames, multi-condition control, compatibility with different backbones, adaptation to unseen control conditions, and video editing. In Ctrl-Adapter, we train adapter layers that fuse pretrained ControlNet features to different image/video diffusion models, while keeping the parameters of the ControlNets and the diffusion models frozen. Ctrl-Adapter consists of temporal and spatial modules so that it can effectively handle the temporal consistency of videos. We also propose latent skipping and inverse timestep sampling for robust adaptation and sparse control. Moreover, Ctrl-Adapter enables control from multiple conditions by simply taking the (weighted) average of ControlNet outputs. With diverse image/video diffusion backbones (SDXL, Hotshot-XL, I2VGen-XL, and SVD), Ctrl-Adapter matches ControlNet for image control and outperforms all baselines for video control (achieving the SOTA accuracy on the DAVIS 2017 dataset) with significantly lower computational costs (less than 10 GPU hours).</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09967</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09967</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 02:55:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Han Lin, Jaemin Cho, Abhay Zala, Mohit Bansal</author></item><item><title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title><description>Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 02:41:27 GMT</pubDate><author>Navonil Majumder, Chia-Yu Hung, Deepanway Ghosal, Wei-Ning Hsu, Rada Mihalcea, Soujanya Poria</author></item></channel></rss>
