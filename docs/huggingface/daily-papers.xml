This alteration needs to balance privacy and utility. While strong obfuscation techniques can effectively hide the author&#39;s identity, they often degrade the quality and usefulness of the text for its intended purpose. Conversely, maintaining high utility tends to provide insufficient privacy, making it easier for an adversary to de-anonymize the author. Thus, achieving an optimal trade-off between these two conflicting objectives is crucial. In this paper, we propose TAROT: Task-Oriented Authorship Obfuscation Using Policy Optimization, a new unsupervised authorship obfuscation method whose goal is to optimize the privacy-utility trade-off by regenerating the entire text considering its downstream utility. Our approach leverages policy optimization as a fine-tuning paradigm over small language models in order to rewrite texts by preserving author identity and downstream task utility. We show that our approach largely reduce the accuracy of attackers while preserving utility. We make our code and models publicly available.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21630</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21630</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 06:54:45 GMT</pubDate><author>Gabriel Loiseau, Damien Sileo, Damien Riquet, Maxime Meyer, Marc Tommasi</author></item><item><title>Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation</title><description>Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) aims to segment and classify sounding objects in videos with acoustic cues. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption and only identify pre-defined categories from training data, lacking the generalization ability to detect novel categories in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a new task: open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, extending AVSS task to open-world scenarios beyond the annotated label space. This is a more challenging task that requires recognizing all categories, even those that have never been seen nor heard during training. Moreover, we propose the first open-vocabulary AVSS framework, OV-AVSS, which mainly consists of two parts: 1) a universal sound source localization module to perform audio-visual fusion and locate all potential sounding objects and 2) an open-vocabulary classification module to predict categories with the help of the prior knowledge from large-scale pre-trained vision-language models. To properly evaluate the open-vocabulary AVSS, we split zero-shot training and testing subsets based on the AVSBench-semantic benchmark, namely AVSBench-OV. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability of our model on all categories. On the AVSBench-OV dataset, OV-AVSS achieves 55.43% mIoU on base categories and 29.14% mIoU on novel categories, exceeding the state-of-the-art zero-shot method by 41.88%/20.61% and open-vocabulary method by 10.2%/11.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/ruohaoguo/ovavss.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21721</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21721</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 05:14:53 GMT</pubDate><author>Ruohao Guo, Liao Qu, Dantong Niu, Yanyu Qi, Wenzhen Yue, Ji Shi, Bowei Xing, Xianghua Ying</author></item><item><title>ShieldGemma: Generative AI Content Moderation Based on Gemma</title><description>We present ShieldGemma, a comprehensive suite of LLM-based safety content moderation models built upon Gemma2. These models provide robust, state-of-the-art predictions of safety risks across key harm types (sexually explicit, dangerous content, harassment, hate speech) in both user input and LLM-generated output. By evaluating on both public and internal benchmarks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models, such as Llama Guard (+10.8\% AU-PRC on public benchmarks) and WildCard (+4.3\%). Additionally, we present a novel LLM-based data curation pipeline, adaptable to a variety of safety-related tasks and beyond. We have shown strong generalization performance for model trained mainly on synthetic data. By releasing ShieldGemma, we provide a valuable resource to the research community, advancing LLM safety and enabling the creation of more effective content moderation solutions for developers.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21772</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21772</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 01:25:17 GMT</pubDate><author>Wenjun Zeng, Yuchi Liu, Ryan Mullins, Ludovic Peran, Joe Fernandez, Hamza Harkous, Karthik Narasimhan, Drew Proud, Piyush Kumar, Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Olivia Sturman, Oscar Wahltinez</author></item><item><title>The Llama 3 Herd of Models</title><description>Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783</link><guid

Our lightweight, in-house-built robot is designed specifically for learning algorithms with low simulation complexity, anthropomorphic motion, and high reliability against falls. The robot&#39;s narrow sim-to-real gap enables agile and robust locomotion across various terrains in outdoor environments, achieved with a simple reinforcement learning controller using light domain randomization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robot traversing for hundreds of meters, walking on a steep unpaved trail, and hopping with single and double legs as a testimony to its high performance in dynamical walking. Capable of omnidirectional locomotion and withstanding large perturbations with a compact setup, our system aims for scalable, sim-to-real deployment of learning-based humanoid systems.

Nevertheless, most of the 3D human avatars modeled from a casually captured video only support body motions without facial expressions and hand motions.In this work, we present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body 3D human avatar learned from a short monocular video. We design ExAvatar as a combination of the whole-body parametric mesh model (SMPL-X) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The main challenges are 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD images. The limited diversity in the video makes animations with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial. In addition, the absence of 3D observations could cause significant ambiguity in human parts that are not observed in the video, which can result in noticeable artifacts under novel motions. To address them, we introduce our hybrid representation of the mesh and 3D Gaussians. Our hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity information (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X. It makes our ExAvatar animatable with novel facial expressions by driven by the facial expression space of SMPL-X. In addition, by using connectivity-based regularizers, we significantly reduce artifacts in novel facial expressions and poses.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21686</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21686</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 01:10:09 GMT</pubDate><author>Gyeongsik Moon, Takaaki Shiratori, Shunsuke Saito</author></item><item><title>Tora: Trajectory-oriented Diffusion Transformer for Video Generation</title><description>Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT&#39;s scalability, allowing precise control of video content&#39;s dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora&#39;s excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa&#39;s potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21770</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21770</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:52:19 GMT</pubDate><author>Xi Victoria Lin, Akshat Shrivastava, Liang Luo, Srinivasan Iyer, Mike Lewis, Gargi Gosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Armen Aghajanyan</author></item><item><title>Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech Translation via LLM Agent</title><description>In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21646</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21646</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:51:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Shanbo Cheng, Zhichao Huang, Tom Ko, Hang Li, Ningxin Peng, Lu Xu, Qini Zhang</author></item><item><title>Data Contamination Report from the 2024 CONDA Shared Task</title><description>The 1st Workshop on Data Contamination (CONDA 2024) focuses on all relevant aspects of data contamination in natural language processing, where data contamination is understood as situations where evaluation data is included in pre-training corpora used to train large scale models, compromising evaluation results. The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.</description><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21530</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21530</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:44:44 GMT</pubDate><author>Oscar Sainz, Iker García-Ferrero, Alon Jacovi, Jon Ander Campos, Yanai Elazar, Eneko Agirre, Yoav Goldberg, Wei-Lin Chen, Jenny Chim, Leshem Choshen, Luca D&#39;Amico-Wong, Melissa Dell, Run-Ze Fan, Shahriar Golchin, Yucheng Li, Pengfei Liu, Bhavish Pahwa, Ameya Prabhu, Suryansh Sharma, Emily Silcock, Kateryna Solonko, David Stap, Mihai Surdeanu, Yu-Min Tseng, Vishaal Udandarao, Zengzhi Wang, Ruijie Xu, Jinglin Yang</author></item><item><title>Fine-gained Zero-shot Video Sampling</title><description>Incorporating a temporal dimension into pretrained image diffusion models for video generation is a prevalent approach. However, this method is computationally demanding and necessitates large-scale video datasets. More critically, the heterogeneity between image and video datasets often results in catastrophic forgetting of the image expertise. Recent attempts to directly extract video snippets from image diffusion models have somewhat mitigated these problems. Nevertheless, these methods can only generate brief video clips with simple movements and fail to capture fine-grained motion or non-grid deformation. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-Shot video Sampling algorithm, denoted as ZS^2, capable of directly sampling high-quality video clips from existing image synthesis methods, such as Stable Diffusion, without any training or optimization. Specifically, ZS^2 utilizes the dependency noise model and temporal momentum attention to ensure content consistency and animation coherence, respectively. This ability enables it to excel in related tasks, such as conditional and context-specialized video generation and instruction-guided video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that ZS^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot video generation, occasionally outperforming recent supervised methods.
