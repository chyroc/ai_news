It&amp;#39;s my first time using LLM framework, thus first time using Langchain too. I&amp;#39;m currently using the Recursive URL Loader integration to recursively fetch data from websites. And, behave as I wanted, but I have some issue with websites using modern frontend frameworks. So, I tried the Playwright Langchain integration (I&amp;#39;m a bit familiar with Playwright), and it&amp;#39;s work on the desired websites, but as you guess, it only works on one page. So my question is there is an integration that do both? Handling JS and recursively browse the website, or how can I combine the two to achieve my goal? I&amp;#39;m open to alternative solution using Puppeteer or even Python example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how I use the Recursive URL Loader:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { RecursiveUrlLoader } from &amp;#39;@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/recursive_url&amp;#39;; import { compile } from &amp;#39;html-to-text&amp;#39;; export async function loadWebsite(url: string, excludeDirs?: string[]) { const compiledConvert = compile({ wordwrap: 130 }); // returns (text: string) =&amp;gt; string; const loader = new RecursiveUrlLoader(url, { extractor: compiledConvert, maxDepth: 1, excludeDirs, preventOutside: true, }); return loader.load(); } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, this is my Playwright attempt:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { PlaywrightWebBaseLoader } from &amp;#39;@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/playwright&amp;#39;; import { MozillaReadabilityTransformer } from &amp;#39;@langchain/community/document_transformers/mozilla_readability&amp;#39;; import { RunnableSequence } from &amp;#39;@langchain/core/runnables&amp;#39;; import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from &amp;#39;@langchain/textsplitters&amp;#39;; export async function loadWebsite(url: string) { const loader = new PlaywrightWebBaseLoader(url, { launchOptions: { chromiumSandbox: false, }, }); const documents = await loader.load(); const transformChain = RunnableSequence.from([ RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage(&amp;#39;html&amp;#39;), new MozillaReadabilityTransformer(), ]); return transformChain.invoke(documents); } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/alex6011&quot;&gt; /u/alex6011 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1doudja/how_to_use_recursive_url_loader_with/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1doudja/how_to_use_recursive_url_loader_with/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1doudja</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1doudja/how_to_use_recursive_url_loader_with/" /><updated>2024-06-26T09:24:56+00:00</updated><published>2024-06-26T09:24:56+00:00</published><title>How to use Recursive URL Loader with Playwright/Puppeteer?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Danidre</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Danidre</uri></author><category term="LangChain" label="r/LangChain"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Preamble&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve realized through blogs and experience, is that it is best to have different agents for different purposes. E.G.: one agent for docs RAG, one agent for API calls, one agent for SQL queries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These agents, by themselves, work quite fine when used in a conversational sense. You can prompt the agent for API calls to reply with follow-up questions to obtain the remaining required parameters for the specific request to be made, based on the user request, and then execute the tool call (fetch request).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the agent for docs RAG can send a response, and the user can follow up with a vague question. The LLM will have the context to know what they&amp;#39;re referring to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how can we merge these three together? I know there are different design patterns such as Hierarchy, and Supervisor. Supervisor sounds like the better approach for this use case: creating a 3th supervisor agent that takes the user request and delegates it to one of the 3 specialized agents. However, these only seem to work when each request perform the action and respond completely in one invocation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the supervisor agent delegates to the API calling agent, and that agent responds with a follow-up question for more information, it goes back up the hierarchy to the supervisor agent and the follow-up question is returned as the response to the user. So if the user then sends more information, of course the invocation starts back at the supervisor agent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How does it keep track of the last sub-agent invoked, whether a user response is to answer a follow-up question, re-invoke the previous agent, whether the user response deviated and required a new agent to be invoked, etc? I have a few ideas, let me know which ones you guys have experienced?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Ideas&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Manual Tracking&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than a 4th agent, the user message is first passed to an LLM with definitions of the types of agents. It&amp;#39;s job is to respond with the name of the agent most likely to handle this request. That agent is then invoked. The last agent called, as well as it&amp;#39;s last response is stored. Follow up user messages call this LLM again with definitions of the type of agents, the message, the last agent invoked, and the last message it replied. The LLM will use this context to determine if it should call that same agent again with the new user message, or another agent instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Supervisor Agent with Agent Named as Messages State&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each sub-agent will have its own isolated messages list, however the supervisor agent will track messages by the name of the agent, to determine who best to delegate the request to. However, it will only track the last response from each invoked agent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Example Conversation:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;User: Hi Agent: Hi, how can I help you today?

User: How many categories have been created today SQL Agent: 8 categories have been created today. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps like this, it can better determine who to delegate future responses to.

Everything is setup but I&amp;#39;m running into an issue with streaming. For some reason, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll find the event object apart of my streamed response (see image). &lt;strong&gt;For reference I&amp;#39;m using the astream_events API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is the overall flow:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

My utility function serialize_chunk is defined as follows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def serialize_chunk(chunk): if isinstance(chunk, dict): return {k: serialize_chunk(v) for k, v in chunk.items()} elif isinstance(chunk, list): return [serialize_chunk(item) for item in chunk] elif ( isinstance(chunk, AIMessageChunk) or isinstance(chunk, SystemMessage) or isinstance(chunk, HumanMessage) or isinstance(chunk, ToolMessage) or isinstance(chunk, ChatPromptValue) or isinstance(chunk, AgentFinish) or isinstance(chunk, AIMessage) ): return chunk.dict() else: return chunk &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know my serialize_chunk is a little unique. It&amp;#39;s what made sense to me when handling the non-serializeable encoding error while sending the agent response to the front end and having it treated as JSON. Thing is, I also don&amp;#39;t even see the .dict() method being mentioned anywhere in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason, sometimes the streamed response will include the event JSON object. I&amp;#39;m pretty lost as to why this is happening. 70% of the time things are rendering and streaming as expected for the most part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c9i1oe3qds8d1.jpg?width=658&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1335ac4c0c835dd8ce5e71c44d5ce50a5de6bcaa&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c9i1oe3qds8d1.jpg?width=658&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1335ac4c0c835dd8ce5e71c44d5ce50a5de6bcaa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/hwchase17&quot;&gt;u/hwchase17&lt;/a&gt; would greattttly appreciate any feedback if you ever see this!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/upandfastLFGG&quot;&gt; /u/upandfastLFGG &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dohi7o/need_help_with_streaming_agent_output_and_am_i/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dohi7o/need_help_with_streaming_agent_output_and_am_i/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_1dohi7o</id><media:thumbnail url="https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hAfDoMI0jhayISnECBe-g0JOcM2uH86Xf2BHB5zdX-8.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dohi7o/need_help_with_streaming_agent_output_and_am_i/" /><updated>2024-06-25T21:34:25+00:00</updated><published>2024-06-25T21:34:25+00:00</published><title>Need help with streaming agent output and am I going crazy or did langchain documentation just change?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/thatsusernameistaken</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/thatsusernameistaken</uri></author><category term="LangChain" label="r/LangChain"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to make some agent using crewai and autogen.

I need to make several tool calls (e.g., for different months). However, it processes these calls sequentially, one at a time, which significantly increases the response time and costs due to token usage. For instance, if I need data for four months, it will:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make the first tool call&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wait for the response&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make the second tool call&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wait for the response&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And so on...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previously, I had implemented parallel function calling with LangChain&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;AgentExecutor&lt;/code&gt; class, where the agent would make all the necessary calls simultaneously, wait for all responses, and then process them together. This parallel calling mechanism has stopped working with LangGraph. Maybe because now the prompt is much larger than before?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any tips or advice?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for your help!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/emersounds&quot;&gt; /u/emersounds &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dnmeuy/help_parallel_function_calling_with_langgraph_and/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dnmeuy/help_parallel_function_calling_with_langgraph_and/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1dnmeuy</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dnmeuy/help_parallel_function_calling_with_langgraph_and/" /><updated>2024-06-24T19:43:01+00:00</updated><published>2024-06-24T19:43:01+00:00</published><title>[HELP] Parallel function calling with Langgraph and Gemini 1.5 Pro</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/fantasyleaguelottery</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/fantasyleaguelottery</uri></author><category term="LangChain" label="r/LangChain"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone implemented a working streamlit app with LangGraph?
