Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/desik1998/NovelWithLLMs/blob/main/Novel.md&quot;&gt;story link&lt;/a&gt; (For now put this on Github itself). The story is about American founding fathers returning back to 21st Century. Currently it consists of 3 chapters and there are 4 more chapters to write. I&amp;#39;ve already reviewed it with few of my friends who&amp;#39;re avid novel readers and most of them have responded with &amp;#39;it doesn&amp;#39;t feel AI written&amp;#39;, it&amp;#39;s interesting (subjective but most have said this), grounds heavily on details. Requesting to read the novel and provide the feedback &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Github Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/desik1998/NovelWithLLMs/tree/main&quot;&gt;https://github.com/desik1998/NovelWithLLMs/tree/main&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Approach to create long story:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;LLMs such as Claude 3 / Gpt 4 currently allows input context length of 150K words and can output 3K words at once. A typical novel in general has a total of 60K-100K words. Considering the 3K output limit, it isn&amp;#39;t possible to generate a novel in one single take. So the intuition here is that let the LLM &lt;strong&gt;generate 1 event at a time and once the event is generated, add it to the existing story and continously repeat this process&lt;/strong&gt;. Although theoretically this approach might seem to work, just doing this leads to LLM moving quickly from one event to another, not being very grounded in details, llm not generating event which is a continuation of the current story, LLM generating mistakes based on the current story etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the following steps are taken: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;1. Initially fix on the high level story:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ask LLM to generate high level plot of the story like at a 30K depth. Generate multiple plots as such. In our case, the high level line in mind was &lt;strong&gt;Founding Fathers returning back&lt;/strong&gt;. Using this line, LLM was asked to generated many plots enhancing this line. It suggested many plots such as Founding fathers called back for being judged based on their actions, founding fathers called back to solve AI crisis, founding fathers come back for fighting against China, Come back and fight 2nd revolutionary war etc. Out of all these, the 2nd revolutionary war seemed the best. Post the plot, LLM was prompted to generate many stories from this plot. Out of these, multiple ideas in the stories were combined (manually) to get to fix on high level story. Once this is done, get the chapters for the high level story (again generated multiple outputs instead of 1). And generating chapters should be easy if the high level story is already present &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;2. Do the event based generation for events in chapter:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once chapters are fixed, now start with the generation of events in a chapter but &lt;strong&gt;1 event at a time like described above&lt;/strong&gt;. To make sure that the event is grounded in details, a little prompting is reqd telling the LLM to avoid moving too fast into the event and ground to details, avoid generating same events as past etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/desik1998/NovelWithLLMs/blob/main/PROMPT.md&quot;&gt;Prompt used till now&lt;/a&gt; (There are some repetitions in the prompt but this works well). Even after this, the output generated by LLM might not be very compelling so to get a good output, generate the output multiple times. And in general generating &lt;strong&gt;5-10 outputs&lt;/strong&gt;, results in a good possible result. And it&amp;#39;s better to do this by varying temperatures. In case of current story, the temperature b/w 0.4-0.8 worked well. Additionally, the rationale behind generating multiple outputs is, given LLMs generate different output everytime, the chances of getting good output when prompted multiple times increases. Even after generating multiple outputs with different temperatures, if it doesn&amp;#39;t yield good results, understand what it&amp;#39;s doing wrong for example like avoid repeating events and tell it to avoid doing that. For example in the 3rd chapter when the LLM was asked to explain the founders about the history since their time, it was rushing off, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/desik1998/NovelWithLLMs/blob/main/HistoryChapterPrompt.md&quot;&gt;an instruction to explain the historic events year-by-year&lt;/a&gt; was added in the prompt. Sometimes the LLM also generates part of the event which is too good but the overall event is not good, in this scenario adding the part of the event to the story and continuing to generate the story worked well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Gist:&lt;/strong&gt; Generate the event multiple times with different temperatures and take the best amongst them. If it still doesn&amp;#39;t work, prompt it to avoid doing the wrong things it&amp;#39;s doing &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall Event Generation: Instead of generating the next event in a chat conversation mode, giving the whole story till now as a combination of events in a single prompt and asking it to generate next event worked better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversation Type 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;human: generate 1st event Claude: Event1 human: generate next, Claude: Event2, human: generate next ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversation Type 2:&lt;/strong&gt; (Better) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Human: Story till now: Event1 + Event2 + ... + EventN. Generate next event Claude: Event(N+1) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also as the events are generated, one keeps getting new ideas to proceed on the story chapters. And if any event generated is so good, but aligns little different from current story, one can also change the future story/chapters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current approach, doesn&amp;#39;t require any code&lt;/strong&gt; and long stories can be generated directly using the &lt;strong&gt;Claude Playground or Amazon Bedrock Playground&lt;/strong&gt; (Claude is hosted). Claude Playground has the best Claude Model Opus which Bedrock currently lacks but given this Model is 10X costly, avoided it and went with the 2nd Best Sonnet Model. As per my experience, the results on Bedrock are better than the ones in Claude Playground &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Questions:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why wasn&amp;#39;t Gpt4 used to create this story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;When asked Gpt4 to generate the next event in the story, there was no coherence in the next event generated with the existing story. Maybe with more prompt engineering, this might be solved but Claude 3 was giving better output without much effort so went with it. Infact, Claude 3 Sonnet (the 2nd best model from Claude) is doing much better when compared to Gpt4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;How much cost did it take to do this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$50-100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Further Improvements:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore ways to avoid long input contexts. This can further reduce the cost considering most of the cost is going into this step. Possible Solutions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Give gists of the events happened in the story till now instead of whole story as an input to the LLM. References: &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.google/research/publications/74917/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/html/2310.00785v3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid the human loop as part of the choosing the best event generated. Currently it takes a lot of human time when choosing the best event generated. Due to this, the time to generate a story can take from few weeks to few months (1-1.5 months). If this step is automated atleast to some degree, the time to write the long story will further decrease. Possible Solutions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use an LLM to determine what are the best events or top 2-3 events generated. This can be done based on multiple factors such as whether the event is a continuation, the event is not repeating itself. And based on these factors, LLM can rate the top responses. References: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.06259&quot;&gt;Last page in this paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Train a reward model (With or without LLM) for determining which generated event is better. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/html/2401.10020v1&quot;&gt;LLM as Reward model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current approach generates only 1 story. Instead generate a Tree of possible stories for a given plot. For example, multiple generations for an event can be good, in this case, select all of them and create different stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the same approach for other things such as movie story generation, Text Books, Product document generation etc &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark LLMs Long Context not only on RAG but also on Generation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Desik_1998&quot;&gt; /u/Desik_1998 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0w79c/used_claudes_200k_context_length_to_write_a_30k/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0w79c/used_claudes_200k_context_length_to_write_a_30k/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c0w79c</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0w79c/used_claudes_200k_context_length_to_write_a_30k/" /><updated>2024-04-10T20:50:00+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-10T20:50:00+00:00</published><title>Used Claude's 200K context length to write a 30K word novel which heavily grounds in details unlike the existing novels</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/usnavy13</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/usnavy13</uri></author><category term="LangChain" label="r/LangChain"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started building internal LLM tools for my company and originally thought LangChain would be a good tool.

The technique is super simple:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1777382373283299365&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1777382373283299365&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Send the request to 3 LLMs - Claude, GPT4, and Perplexity.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Give the responses to Claude again and prompt engineer to pick the best and accurate response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got curious about this and decided to do some evaluations on this approach. Sharing some metrics/measurements in this post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one is pretty obvious, the latency on having all 3 LLMs generate a response and picking the best out of the 3 is high. But, I do recognize that this can be improved by parallelizing the operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lndc3gwp3ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=02ec4109e9a3211724686a40ecbb9110dc70033c&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lndc3gwp3ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=02ec4109e9a3211724686a40ecbb9110dc70033c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ran the following tests for both the combined AI Oracle approach and using a single LLM:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factual Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; - Evaluated for correctness of responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realtime data&lt;/strong&gt; - Evaluated based on asking information related to realtime data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Evaluated on whether the LLM is able to pickup the signal correctly by placing the question in between a bunch of garbage data. The LLM was given a positive score if it correctly responded to the question without mentioning the garbage data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency checks&lt;/strong&gt; - Evaluated on whether the LLM gave a response consistently when the same question was asking many times. Mainly looked for structural consistency of the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality&lt;/strong&gt; - Evaluated on the quality - sentence structure, adherence to the prompt etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Oracle Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Results for the AI Oracle approach: For some reason, it could not pick up the realtime information even once. I am sure with some prompt engineering, this metric can be improved. It did poorly on Adversarial testing - mostly because Claude and Pplx&amp;#39;s responses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9ggjkthz3ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=033d105e3793e68fb5b2bd9a134cbbefec423cc7&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9ggjkthz3ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=033d105e3793e68fb5b2bd9a134cbbefec423cc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude (claude-3-opus-20240229)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected, Claude did not do well on Realtime testing. But, interestingly, it did not do great with adversarial and consistency tests either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/b33q8qz24ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ef154b780655bb520c406d1aa53c8b91fc2c8038&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b33q8qz24ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ef154b780655bb520c406d1aa53c8b91fc2c8038&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, GPT4 does not have realtime capabilities. But it did extremely well on everything else except consistency checks where the responses were structured quite differently each time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2jz4y6864ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a35bfe557f4164251c4900d4e2c62cf8a5c7b04d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2jz4y6864ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a35bfe557f4164251c4900d4e2c62cf8a5c7b04d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity (pplx-70b-online)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected Perplexity&amp;#39;s realtime capabilities are unmatched. But, it did not do that well with adversarial and consistency tests which in turn skewed the metrics for AI Oracle approach as well.Notably, the quality of responses from Perplexity were far better than the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/y0mqsr4b4ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3ba1acfd7159b8f0bd5164a0e99af7f8ab4f5071&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y0mqsr4b4ltc1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3ba1acfd7159b8f0bd5164a0e99af7f8ab4f5071&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you can get a near perfect score for the AI Oracle approach with a bit of prompt engineering. But you definitely lose performance in the process. Even when parallelized, it is only as slow as the slowest LLM. Token usage/cost is also going to be higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are curious, all these evaluations were done using Langtrace - an open source LLM monitoring and evaluations tool that I am currently developing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Github: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptokaykay&quot;&gt; /u/cryptokaykay &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0do04/results_of_evaluating_the_ai_oracle_approach_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0do04/results_of_evaluating_the_ai_oracle_approach_a/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_1c0do04</id><media:thumbnail url="https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/GCdPwBj4teGkowjNA4iTF6pGHJldADy1b4cFZ_8gtFI.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1c0do04/results_of_evaluating_the_ai_oracle_approach_a/" /><updated>2024-04-10T05:11:47+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-10T05:11:47+00:00</published><title>Results of evaluating the AI Oracle approach - a novel way to improve your LLM application's accuracy</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Dear_Insect_5295</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Dear_Insect_5295</uri></author><category term="LangChain" label="r/LangChain"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using a Mistral model 4b and huggingface&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipeline text_generation_pipeline = pipeline( model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, task=&amp;quot;text-generation&amp;quot;, batch_size=2 ) llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=text_generation_pipeline,batch_size=2) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;and then using RAG through langchain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rag_chain_from_docs = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs(x[&amp;quot;context&amp;quot;]))) | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) rag_chain_with_source = RunnableParallel( {&amp;quot;context&amp;quot;: retriever, &amp;quot;question&amp;quot;: RunnablePassthrough()} ).assign(answer=rag_chain_from_docs) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;My GPU (T4) is underutilized, its only 8GB/16GB. so I want to use all of My GPU, Is there any way to do this, I tried chain.batch() but it did not work(It still ran sequentially).
